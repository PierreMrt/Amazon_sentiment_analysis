DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PHONE
","

  PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. They say that the phone is unlocked but it is NOT and the only way to get it unlocked is to go to the original carrier, however it is impossible to find out who the carrier was. I bought 3 different SIM cards none of them worked. Talked to so many different carriers to resolve the issue and nothing was resolved. I sent the phone back, got my refund, and purchase a phone directly from Apple. I wish I could get all my time and energy back I used to try and get this phone to work. Disappointed.

PHONE GLITCHY - DOES NOT WORK!

   I bought two phones for my two sons this weekend. One works just fine, one immediately started spazzing and glitching and putting up multiple screens at a time. It’s impossible to use. I’ve been on the phone all day with Apple customer service and now they say I have to take it to the Apple store to verify it’s not working. I’m very frustrated. I just want each phone I bought to be useable and not have to drive all over creation the day before Thanksgiving.

Battery life hello
","

  I love how A good price I got this phone for it's just has a little scratch but that's what happens when you get refurbished Items but I'm complaining about the battery life I charged it to 100% and I only used it for 7 mins I thought I had a good buy but to check the battery percentage it dropped significantly at first I thought I was tripping it came to me at 50 percent and it died fast so I let it charge to 100 and as you can see the picture it dies fast I needed a replacement because my oldnphone broke just be careful if any of you guys going to buy it and this happens I never complained about anything or reviewed stuff but just be sure to look out for little things like that I contacted the seller I'm just waiting to see what he or she to respond

Arrived with cracked screen, Spend the extra $99 & buy new from Apple!
","

  I figured with the description of such slight defects that may be acceptable by Amazon for a refurbished iPhone XR it would be worth it to save $99 by ordering a refurbished for $500 rather than order a brand new one from Apple for $599.When I first opened the box, updated the phone and got it set up with my apps, everything was great. Then I went to the Apple store to buy a screen protector and some other accessories. When I was putting on the screen protector I noticed a crack which runs almost the entire length of the screen. It appears the seller buffed this and possibly used a glass filler to hide the cracked screen. I’ve taken photos to share.I ordered this phone as I’m traveling and needed a new phone. Well I have no choice but to eat this scam by Amazon and the seller because I’m traveling and don’t have an option to not use this phone.Amazon should require high quality photos of actual products on sale. Not images copied from Apples marketing of a product.

Good Phone but Average Condition
","

  Phone arrived as Holiday present. Screen condition was acceptable, not as good as had hoped for per the description (Good condition with minimal defects not visible at a certain distance but there were some defects visible at all distances including one specific defect that obscured some of the battery strength). Since it was a gift and unable to return in time we decided to continue with it. Functionality had no issues over the first few months until the last several weeks the phone has had some charging issues (not charging and battery losing charge rapidly). Now we have a battery error statement and iPhone cannot recognize this battery as a genuine iPhone battery. We are outside of the return window so have contacted Apple. I will update my review when we learn of the problem and how / if we can remedy it. Disappointed with the product and wish i had returned it originally when first received.

iMessage and FaceTime cannot activate
","

  Phone came in acceptable conditions. Scratches on the side. All aspects of the phone work except for FaceTime and IMessage. I went into an Apple store and was directed to call a technician, called 3 over the phone who told me the same thing to restart my phone and would not call back after I restarted my phone. The last one I make sure I skip that trouble shoot solver and move on, he said there was a problem (probably) with my carrier. Went over to my carrier and had someone tinker with setting on my phone to no avail but in her defense she is not Apple technician. She confirmed that my plan is what it is and that there shouldn’t be any problems. I then call amazon who then after describing my problem calls iPhone and put me back through that process over the phone where I did not get a call back again. I messaged amazon and this guy Mark seems To be the most helpful and recommended I try to replace the phone. Might return all together and get rid of this headache

Amazon Renewed XR with 90% battery health is actually 50% through its useful lifespan...
","

  Got my Amazon Renewed iPhone XR from TRADEMORE. As advertised, the ""renewed"" phone //could// come with a 90% battery health. Yep, it showed up with a 92% battery health. If you think that's an ""A"" and it must have 92 more percents to go before it's dead, you're mistaken...At 80% battery health, Apple flags your phone as ""significantly degraded"" and notes that it is in need of service to function correctly and reliably. Around that time, Apple throttles your device performance to keep it alive on a charge. What this means is that 80% means your phone is in ""hospice care"" and less, you're dead. That means that a 90% battery health stat means your phone has only 50% of its remaining potential charges left before Apple deems your phone ready to leave this world.In simplest terms, ""Amazon Renewed"" appears to mean; Phones that were well cared for aesthetically, but whose internals are heavily used, abused, and at half-life. When I made this purchase, I *hoped* the 90% threshold was a legal 'cover our aces' move, but turns out not -- turns out a half-beat phone with 200 charges left before Apple deems the device unreliable is what you get.Buyer beware. Apple charges $69 to replace an XR battery, so take this cost, add $69, and that's the actual cost of this ""renewed"" device.Otherwise, I'm sure the brand new, $700 iPhone XR is a real gem! Love the shape, feel, and usability of this machine.

Bad front camera quality
","

  The phone was obviously used. The edges were a little scraped up and there was a lot of gunk in the speaker next to the front camera. None of this was bad enough to make me want to get rid of it. What made me return the phone was the fact that the front camera quality was terrible. The 1st pic is the Amazon phone front camera. The 2nd pic is the Apple store front camera. I mainly bought this phone FOR the cameras (I feel like most people do.) While the back camera was fine, the front one was a deal breaker. I considered asking for another phone from the company, but for $150 more I would have rather purchased a brand new iPhone and save myself the worry. I originally thought I’d be saving some money, but it wasn’t worth it in the end.

Phone is of good quality, almost ruined by poor screen protector application
","

  I received my refurbished iPhone yesterday, and so far it has been functioning well. The battery health on the phone says 100%, and there is only minimal evident scratching on the back. My only issue is with whoever put the tempered screen protector on the phone. They must have some serious hand-eye coordination problems as the glass is horribly off center and slightly hangs off the bottom. I’m going to look around to see if any shops can remove it and reapply it correctly, it is pretty annoying and if I had seen images of it beforehand I definitely would have not purchased the phone.

Hoping the next phone works better
","

  I ordered this coral iPhone  xr for my mother and I was so excited when I got the phone because it looks like brand new. My mother noticed that one part of the screen is dead and honestly I didn’t believe her until I try to type something on the keyboard and I noticed the backspace button doesn’t work. I tried to open another app to see if it was a software glitch but it’s not. I’m assuming it has to do with the screen. I’m going to return this phone and see if i can get another one because the quality is great is just that part of the screen that doesn’t work properly.

Way too many screen scratches
","

  Received the phone and it looked great. The red color is beautiful. Unfortunately the disappointment came when turning it over. Screen looked great except that there was a big scratch. At first we thought it was on the surface of the screen protector. So we removed it to replace it with another one and that is when we realized the scratch and more where on the actual screen. For claiming to be renewed and for the price it is a disappointment. I would return it but it was a gift for my daughter and she fell in love with the color and she does not want to be without it. Lesson learned. Do not buy phones at Amazon.

  I thought my girlfriend was crazy when see keep saying the phone didn't have service and wasn't getting texts messages.So 4 months ago I got her a new phone and had this iPhone X laying around and I gave it to my buddy thinking theres nothing wrong with it. Well I was wrong within 2 days he called me from another number and told me the same problems my girlfriend said she had with the phone.So I believe the issue is the sim card reader and its been a problem but I didn't listen and now I might be stuck with a very nice hardly used iPhone X.

Great product, misleading reviews
","

  I was very hesitant to buy this product, but I took the risk because it was an Amazon product. The cell phone took 1 extra day for delivery. It was BRAND NEW, or at least it looked like. The phone was perfect. Clean IMEI and unlocked BUT apparently it was a Verizon phone which is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH Tmobile network. I called the seller multiple times and did not replied to maybe change the product for one that worked for me but no luck. I submitted a request to returned it and they immediately replied and make things smooth.

Not good, rip off

  I ordered this phone and it came with a defect on the screen- where it had been damaged. The screen was scratched up from prior use and had an old screen protector on it. The phone is slow and you can tell something has happened to it. If they are going to sell products at this quality it should be HALF as much as they are selling it for. Not original charger, no headphones.

READ BEFORE YOU BUY

  Phone that I received came with 100% battery life. The phone also came with noticeable dents to the aluminum housing. I am relieved to say that the phone was free from scratches on screen and camera. Generally a good phone but not labled correctly since it had noticeable wear to the phone’s housing.P.S. Ran into difficultly while activating the phone took like 2 HOURS to activate. It was the phones fault since I checked everything on my end.

Slight savings for a used phone
","

  I’d rate this phone 3.5 stars. Overall, I cannot complain.  It functions properly. Battery life is at 99%. There are mild scratches on the side and back of the phone (more than what I have on my iPhone 7, but I’m particular with my stuff). It came with a generic charger and was in a standard box, not an apple one. There is mild-moderate dirt/lint in the cracks/crevices/speaker cover. It came with a screen protector installed, which was unfortunately installed a little off-center. It does not appear this phone was disassembled and fully refurbished. It appears to be a used phone. Would I buy another one?  I’m not sure. I’d highly consider buying a brand new one from Apple for $180 more, that way you know exactly what you’re getting.  However, if you just need a phone and are ok with minor cosmetic blemishes, this could be a way to save a little money over a new phone.

Screen Malfunction
","

  I purchased this phone as an upgrade from my iPhone 7plus other than it missing a fave feature of mine, the 3D Touch this phone is definitely an upgrade.The quality of the device I received was decent. No obvious scratches, dings, or issues. The main complaint I have is that every about ten minutes of use or so, my screen is unresponsive. I have to completely click off my screen and reopen my device to regain control of the screen again. Idk what the issue is but I have updated the device, turned it all the way off and on again so now my only hunch, is that it was due to this being a refurbished device. I just wish it was disclosed in the product description.I feel with this malfunction the value for money isn’t quite there, but that’s what I get for purchasing online I suppose.Buyers please purchase with caution and knowledge that you may receive a device that only works sometimes!

Speaker Issue
","

  The phone looked great!  A couple of surface scratches on the top right of the screen, but that's to be expected I guess with a used phone.  I wasn't really concerned with those small issues. I transferred everything from my old phone and completely set up the new phone and everything was great!  I was soooo excited and felt really great about my purchase,.....until I made a call.  It wasn't until I had invested several hours into the new phone that I realized the ear speaker has a shattery sound and makes it difficult to hear the other person on the call.  The speaker does technically work, but the voice sounds muffled and shattered, like an old busted car speaker.  I really hate it because I like the phone and spent so much time setting everything up to be personalized to me.  If I new the quality of the speaker before hand, I would have returned it immediately, but at this point I think I will just deal with it.  I don't like change and it took me forever to upgrade from an Iphone 5S (crystal clear speaker btw) to the XR, and unfortunately it was just a bad experience because of the speaker issue.  The phone is excellent other than this one issue, but a key feature of the a phone is to have conversations with others right?  I needed this phone for my personal and business use, so I hope the speaker doesn't continue to degrade.I'm not sure how the company tests for sound quality and clarity, but I would encourage everyone if you decide to purchase a used phone, call someone on the phone first before personalizing it to you.

get what u pay for

  It’s refurbished so I was not expecting perfection , the phone itself came looking beautiful only defect was the red paint around the camera lens was chipping away but the rest of the phone was perfect . However the charger it came with did not work at all so I had to order a new one . Not good 👎🏽 Also the screen glitches a lot . It will touch things /type when my finger is not even on the screen and sometimes too when I touch the screen it doesn’t work , I will have to click it off and on again for it to move . It works for the most part and the camera is ok but probably if you want an iPhone just go buy a new one

Maybe a good option if you don't mind the visible cosmetic damage.
","

  Device had a lot more cosmetic issues than I would have expected. Clearly visible scratches and scuffs on the back and edges of the phone. I get that it's a reverb but I've gotten refurbished devices directly from one of the major carriers in the past that were visibly like new. I would think for the money the device would have fewer if any cosmetic issues. I've given the criteria 4 stars as function seems to be good though it's hard to give it a good workover as I've only had it for a few days. Battery needs to go through more charging cycles to determine how well it holds a charge.

Great phone for the price.
","

  So my wife was in the market for a new iPhone, upgrading from her iPhone 6, which was now obsolete according to several required apps she uses for work. I couldn't bring myself to pay Apple 800 dollars or more for a new basic phone. I tried to get my wife to agree to an Android and that wasn't going to happen. Then I found these Amazon Renewed phones. I wound up saving about 175 dollars on an almost new iPhone Xr.The phone was delivered when it said it would be delivered and does appear as new as possible, less the original packaging and equipment. The box was a repackage box, the power adapter was an unknown USB wall charger and the cable was a lightning cable although it had a crack in the lightning plug housing so it will last about a week.The migration from old phone to new phone took about an hour, with an iOS upgrade in for good measure (this phone came with 12.2 and 12.4 has been out for only a few weeks so it is close to current).Overall, happy about the phone. Time will tell if I run into issues with it lasting but so far all is good.

Beautiful iPhone and great value

  This is a beautiful iPhone however I had some issues with mine periodically it would freeze up and I even had problems with the rotation at one point it took 10 minutes till I was able to get it upright. I even had a few texts messages ithat it wasn’t delivered. But I read some great reviews before I purchased it and I would agree that this phone is a great value and if I haven’t mentioned it’s absolutely gorgeous I would absolutely recommend this phone and the seller they reached out to me right away. Because of my issues is the only reason I give this review a 4 stars. I would recommend that if you purchase this phone make sure that you purchase a case and a screen protector because you don’t want to lose your investment it’s just that beautiful. I truly love this phone and I’m sure you will too. You can buy everything on Amazon so go for it and don’t hesitate.

Battery not at 100%
","

  I spent almost a month with this phone and their hasn't been any problems with data, battery, calls, quality, or anything else. I switched from an iphone 6s, which doesn't turn on anymore, and it is amazing not having to charge 2-3 times a day. This battery is fine throughout the whole day with mild to intense use. With mild use and school going on, the battery can last me almost 2 days. I've seen reviews where the battery comes at 100% but mine was not included in those cases. My phone came at 92% and that annoys me a little but it's worth the 100 dollars I save by not buying it from the apple store. I am not sure about waterproofing but my phone came without a scratch or a chip on the aluminum paint. It was like it was new besides for the fact of the battery. I was really happy with it but another annoying thing was that they didn't require a signature with the delivery, my neighbors have stolen airpods that I've ordered before so I was quite annoyed by the fact that they just left it in the mail box without making me personally accept it or sign for it. Beware about that if you live in a shady neighborhood or busy street.

Great Purchase So Far Despite a Couple of Minor Issues
","

  This is my first phone purchase in almost a decade. I am going from an iPhone 5s to an iPhone XR.I asked someone for advice for where to purchase my next iPhone. I have a lack of trust when it comes to purchasing phones on the internet after hearing about so many stories of people being scammed. I was told by a couple of people that amazon has registered users so I gave it a try.So far I am happy with my purchase. The iPhone is in like new condition with no major scratches. However, there are two little scratch indentations on the front screen. They are hardly noticeable because they are to the side of the front just off the LCD screen and screen protector and do not interfere with the use of the phone.When it comes to the actual phone itself, the big screen, sound quality, and fast processor are something to smile about. Apple outdid themselves with this phone. The only thing that will take some getting use to is the big slim design. I find it hard to reach some parts of the screen while holding the phone in one hand. I think there is an adjustment period. The phone was incredibly easy to set-up. I just had to back my old iPhone up to iTunes and then restore that backup on the XR.I do not like how there is no headphone jack and that the phone only has 64g storage but this can be overlooked. (I know that I also have the option of purchasing a different model that has better storage and a headphone jack I just thought it is worth mentioning for anyone considering to buy this item.)Pros-Great price. Fast shipping time. Sold from someone trustworthy. Honest listing and as described. Came with screen protector and SIM removal tool. The phone indicates that the battery life is at 95%.As a phone, great quality overall. The LCD screen is big and bright. The sound is fantastic. The processor is super fast (I think one of the fastest processors you can purchase in a smartphone).Cons-The phone came with a knockoff charger not an OEM (original) Apple charger or headphones. Yes, using an Apple charger versus using a knock off makes a difference, look into it if you do not believe me. Fortunately I have my old Apple chargers. The screen has a couple miner indented scratches. My finger covers the mic at the bottom of the phone sometimes when I record videos. The audio gets blocked or becomes scratchy.I made this review as detailed as possible because I greatly benefited from other reviews made by other people that purchased this phone.One major takeaway from all of the comments on this listing is to be careful that you may or may not get a phone that has some sort of issue. I think this comes with the territory when it comes to purchasing a renewed phone. When you are spending a lot of money on a phone you expect quality and consistency. For a couple of hundred dollars more I could have bought straight from Apple, but I am happy I got to save that money.

Awkward Size, but Okay for the Price
","

  It may take months or a year to see if the reconditioned quality is good. Phone arrived fast and looks brand new - no scratches or other problems. Came with cord and USB/AC adapter. Does NOT come with the touch pen shown in the picture. Does not come with SIM card. Camera seems all right. Vibrant color and clarity. The audio is great - voice quality on calls is very good when set on speaker. Music and video sound are excellent, too. The battery life is good - lasts longer between charges, considering I am listening to audio books for hours. Compatible with Credo Mobile. I got a great discounted data plan with savings that will make up for the cost of the phone.The only reason I upgraded is that my eyesight is aging, and I need bigger screen. That said, the XR screen  isn't as big as the brand new models, but it's an improvement over past models. The 6.1"" phone doesn't fit well or balance in my hand like the old 5s or SE. I have large hands, but the phone is awkward to hold and heavy compared to older models. Functionality is fine, once I turned off most the extraneous or obtrusive OS features. I haven't figured out how to disable the emergency SOS. You need to look at the screen when turning the phone off to make sure you don't accidentally swipe it. Also, I miss the Home push button on older models. I've had the phone a week and already hate all the swiping. I never liked Siri, so I am stuck with swiping.

  I went through probably all of the reviews and a switch between sellers a lot.! But I am happy with my iPhone XR RED.I ordered mine through QD ELECTRONICS. Which I think is useful to know because you can never tell which seller is selling the more quality phone if no one mentions the seller.Only negative was how the phone was packaged in the box didn’t seem like it was protective enough.

Mint condition phone on second try

  I must say this was my first time buying a refurbished phone and I was skeptical about it but I read reviews and many said they got nearly mint condition phones. So I bought it and they sent me a phone with plenty of scratches on the screen. I found that unacceptable and I contacted the seller. I returned that phone and they sent me a phone that’s immaculate. I mean it might as well be brand new and the battery is PERFECT. I don’t have to charge this battery more than once a day with moderate use. This is my first iPhone as well and although there are some features I wish they had that were more like Android I can now understand the iPhone fanboys. The seller was so accommodating and I feel like I got a brand new phone for much cheaper than regular price. I wish I could give 4.5 instead of 4 stars and the only reason why I would deduct a half star is because they gave me a bad charger. Because of that I can’t give a 5 star review. Sorry. But I used my Samsung fast charger with the iPhone cord and it charges fast now. Other than that I highly recommend this seller.

So Far So Good

  Like everyone else, I was apprehensive buying such an expensive phone with no guarantee if it will work or not. But it came 2 days after ordering, I will say packing was great. Phone was nicely packaged in a plastic wrap, on first sight I thought it was a new phone. I inspected the hell out it. It’s in absolutely pristine condition. Absolutely no marks on this phone. It’s beautiful. I was a little worried when I turned it on to set it up and update iOS. It had stated it would take 7 hours but it actually took maybe 2 hours (a little less).  Battery is great at 100%. So far I have no complaints about this phone. I’m giving it 4 stars just because I just got it.  The description of the phone and it’s components are exactly what I got.

I was hesitant to buy it due to the bad reviews, but my phone is unlocked (checked with Apple) and I love it. My seller was 2019bestsale, it’s a little bit more expensive but worth it.

Don’t listen to all the negative reviews!
","

  I’ll admit after reading through the reviews I was VERY hesitant but I am BEYOND happy with my purchase.The phone is FLAWLESS. Yes you read that right, absolutely flawless. It came with a glass screen protector already installed and all OEM accessories. Phone has a BRAND NEW 100% capacity battery and is still under factory warranty until May 2020. I understand some of this will vary but this is a review of my experience.I purchased another “renewed” phone, Pixel 2XL, from a different seller and it’s perfectly functional but no where near the condition this iPhone XR arrived in.I just popped my SIM card in and it worked right away. Usually with my carrier I have to call in with the imei number but I didn’t have to. I also tried a GSM SIM card and it worked too, fully unlocked as advertised.Best. Used. Phone. Purchase. Ever.So glad I did not listen to all the negative reviews!

Reading my review will answer all of your concerns about this phone.
","

  I’ve had my phone for a couple of weeks now to be sure that my Xr is working properly. In short, I made bullet points about my review for this phone.*Also to 100% assure you that this is a legitimately honest review I am going to (1) submit photos and videos of the phone and how it works and (2) I’m making this review right now on this phone.😂 Hopefully I’ve answered all concerns and questions.💕NOTE : I chose the Black IPhone XR, 64GBORDER DATES• I received my phone right on time! The order dates were estimated to be May 22-May 26 and I received mine May 22. In my opinion that’s very plausible, because I did not expect for my phone to arrive as early as it did.SHIPPING• The shipping was great (obviously if it arrived on time.) It came in a regular amazon shipping box and the phone was concealed and secured with bubble wrap inside. It came with a IOS charger (usb battery and cord), which came in good condition as well as if it was brand new.WARRANTY • This was in my virtual purchase. When I made the order at the bottom of the screen, it said that I was provided with 90 day warranty for the phone! I’m not so sure if it’s just Amazon’s given policy or the company’s, but regardless I’m grateful!QUALITY• When I took the Xr out the package, it was extremely hot, but it’s understandable because we are in the summer season. However due to the phone being hot, the touch screen ability was a bit laggy. I wanted to say this because if you were to receive your phone like this, I’d recommend to leave the phone sitting for a while for it to cool down and you’ll be good to go.• The phone I would say had about 80% of battery life.• The camera quality is unreal!!! It’s beautiful! It’s clear and concise. No lagging when your in motion. No scratches on the camera OR on the phone anywhere! The entire quality of the phone legitimately looked as if it was brand new from the apple store!IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER• Please, please read this. Check your settings instantly! The minute you receive the phone and it’s plugged in to a charger and you’re finished doing the regular iPhone activation, go to the settings and be sure that your phone isn’t on supervision mode!* Supervision Mode - is a mode for typically electronic devices that is enabled from the carrier.(which in this case the amazon supplier for this phone.) Supervision Mode is only enabled from the carrier/supplier so that they can track if the phone arrived at its correct destination. It’s nothing to be too alarmed about, however, I just wanted to be sure that whoever decides to purchase this phone that you be sure to turn the supervision mode off. Supervision Mode is only used by technology companies. Therefore, they are able to control your phone instantly if that mode is still on. Again, this mode is only supposed to be used from technology services only. If anything look at it as better protection for your phone. If you were to email them saying “hey I didn’t receive my phone” and the order date passed then they can instantly control the phone and have it shutdown and so on. All I ask is that you be sure that your privacy is 100% sacred. You can disable this function by clicking “GENERAL” —— Scroll all the way down and click “RESET” ——— And click “ERASE ALL CONTENT AND SETTINGS” you must click the last option so it can permanently terminate the supervision mode. If you click “reset all settings” instead of the last option I listed above, it is not going to take off supervision mode. (Again if you don’t believe me, search it up on YouTube or on sites on how to do it. It’s going to back up what I just informed you about.)SATISFACTION• So far, that’s about it. That’s all that I can think of about this phone. It arrived in extremely well condition. It’s 100% authentic. (You can search videos to determine that yourself.) No scratches. No glitches. The sound is as loud and clear as if it’s a movie theater surround sound. Everything works as if you bought it from apple. Which by the way I was sooo close to buying the XR from apple, and the price was $600 and something. Compared to this??? Bought for I’d say around or between $468?! I’d say that’s a price you cannot beat!QUESTIONS• If anyone has any questions about this phone, please don’t hesitate to reply to me in the comments! Xo💕

  Update: 10/27/2020: My phone still works the same way it did when I got it even though I’ve dropped it and mishandled it a few times :)Update 03/14/2020: This phone still works perfectly. I don’t carry my charger with me during the day anymore. 64GB is a perfect amount of storage. This phone has frozen up less than 5 times since I got it. Screen still looks great (I cracked it but it’s working) and everything is still fast and accurate. I’ve had no issues. This is the best phone I’ve had in a while. Also the camera is amazing and I’ve come to fall in love with it. (I’ve attached a picture I took with the phone below)My phone is amazing! Obviously I’d show it if I wasn’t on it right now. I waited a few days before making this review so I could make sure no quirks popped up.First of all this is the best battery life I’ve ever had on a phone EVER. I went out for 8 hours and came home and my phone was on 74% at the end of the day. Same thing with school. My phone was at about 50% at the end of the school day. Now it charges pretty slowly in my opinion but the slow charging is definitely worth the battery.Size wise the phone is pretty big. It is a handful to hold and hard to throw in my pocket. The screen size is beautiful for watching videos and doing digital stuff but the phone is just a little big.The software works perfectly. The touch is fine, Face ID is incredibly fast and accurate, and it opens apps very fast. It also responds really well to my touch. My last phone did not.The speaker is amazing. It’s so loud that I didn’t even need my speaker in the shower. The phone was loud enough by itself. I took a call in a room full of noisy kids and my dad said he couldn’t even really hear them. So they cancel noise. Microphone is good. I can say “hey Siri” quietly and it’ll activate.Overall I’m really impressed. I was very nervous looking at other reviews but my phone is working so perfectly right now. I am definitely satisfied especially with paying $200 less than apple was charging.Then again I upgraded from a cracked 6s so that could be the reason I’m so over the moon haha

Received Defective Phone

  The iPhone 7 I purchased was ""certified refurbished"" and labeled as ""new"" quality but doesn't work. The phone looks great, but when I first turned it on it was in a restart loop. This was a bad sign to begin with, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and connected it to my computer. When I finally got it to restore to factory settings, the screen started glitching to the point where there was nothing to stop it, and if it did get to the startup screen, it was non-responsive.The shipping took a few days, but at least it came when scheduled.I have been unable to make contact with the company, but I will update my review if they are able to fix the issue and if I receive a working phone.Update: Ended up returning the phone and purchasing elsewhere. The company was cooperative with the return. Of course this could have been a one-off issue

  I am very disappointed!!! I've ordered and had success with a previous refurbished phone.  However, this iphone 7 with 128 GB was stated as unlocked, which it was.  It was stated that it was Verizon compatible.  It clearly was not.  The Verizon techs stated that the system on this phone had to be from another country whose systems are totally incompatible with US carrier systems.  We spent hours at the Verizon store just to have to purchase a brand new phone from them.  I watched.  They tried everything to make my refurbished work.  Very frustrated and never doing this refurbished phone thing again.

  Returning. For one, it was not an unlocked phone.

Don’t buy from BuySpry or Amazon Refurbished
","

  I bought this phone amazon refurbished and paid a premium for it since I figured it would be a better quality phone that would perform like new. Boy was I wrong, anything you buy that says refurbished means it was once broken and will most likely still be broken when you receive it like in my case. They tell you they fully inspect the phone for faulty hardware but they don’t at all, if they did they would realize that the earpiece was blown and now I can’t hear anybody clearly when on the phone or when I play a video it uses the earpiece as a speaker and sounds horrible, the proximity sensor also never worked and my screen doesn’t turn off when I make a call, I am constantly putting people on hold because my cheek presses the button every time. The battery came in at 84% capacity so right out the gate it needed a new battery because the speed of the phone is lowered by apple if you have a worn battery. All of these defects were present as soon as I received the phone and should of been tested for. Buyspry will sell you a junk phone that looks nice but is unusable as an actual phone. Amazon just turns its back on this practice and defaults any questions or repairs back to BuySpry instead of backing their 90 day refurbished electronics gaurantee. The phone has numerous glitches with the software as well, all around I feel duped to have bought this phone and paid extra for the “amazon refurbished” seal which does nothing for you. Don’t buy, go to apple directly for refurbished phones.

  Bought 2 phones (same) Beautiful condition. One with a screen protector in place, the other without.Problem. Not for US market. Japanese phone.  Not a problem, except... Can't get a battery change in USA. Apple store said they are grey market, and somehow locked to AT+T despite being from another country. Can't silence the camera (ever)- so unable to use social media selfies- important to the kids- not a big deal for me, but makes the phones not useable at their school.Attempting a return through the vendor.

  I actually never write reviews. I am a business owner and I know what it feels like to have a bad review posted. That being said I want to warn the consumer.I ordered the phone it being factory refurbished I new it was risky but, the savings was enough to consider. The phone worked for a total of two days. Then began to shut of and continue restarting and then saying on for about 1 second and shutting down again. I then had to go a verizon store and just get a phone because I needed a phone by that time...Hear is the biggest hassle to return the phone you have to take Iphone cloud off. I couldn't do that because my phone wouldn't turn on. I called them and they sent me a link. I had to login and switch the phone to no longer in use. For most people that may not be a problem. I'm not very tech savy so again it was just more of a hassle.The company did have amazing customer service they picked up right away. That why this isn't a 1 star. They also had an easy solution to turning the Iphone  cloud off.

Looks great, battery won't hold charge long - not covered under warranty
","

  Phone was in great shape.  However, the battery kept draining very quickly.  I do not run videos or surf the internet and deleted everything I could that showed it used much battery life.  Even though the health of the battery screen would show Max capacity of 73%, after one or two short phone calls, the battery would drain quickly by almost 35% on the spot many times.  I called the seller within my 3 month phone warranty period to explain I had a bad battery and had done all I could to make it work.  They said the battery isn't covered under the phone warranty and that I should buy a new battery.  After explaining it came with a battery that drains quickly the seller said they would give my a $12 ""courtesy refund"".  I found out that new batteries cost $50 installed.  They said the max they would give me was $20 but to this day, I have not received anything.  I scheduled and took it to an Apple store and paid the $50 myself.  Beware, these phones from this seller can come with a bad battery and you are basically on your own to schedule a replacement and pay for it.  I had already paid Verizon to change my old Iphone to this one so sending the whole phone back in for a replacement or refund would mean I would have had to reschedule Verizon and pay them again to change phone information.  Easier for me to have Apple put in a new battery.  What an amazing amount of scheduling and time wasted.

Not a good deal.

  Overall, the phone seems in great condition. However a few things I realized afterward: the price is only around $50 lower than a brand new iPhone 7and it doesn’t come with earbuds or a dongle. It didn’t even come with an official apple charger. It was some offbrand charger. I somewhat blame myself for not doing more research on the matter, but in the end I was not satisfied with this purchase and would recommend trying to find a more inexpensive option or just buying the brand new iPhone 7.

Apple is not really the seller
","

  Be cautious, this says Apple is the seller but once you purchase it will update the ""sold by"" line to a third-party seller (mine was called MyWit). That means you're not covered by Apple protections on a refurbished device. The phone I got didn't have it's battery replaced in the refurbishment. I had Apple run a test within a month of purchase and they said it definitely needed to be replaced (battery drained to 25% after using it for 3 hours) and it would cost $30 for a new battery (I eventually talked Apple out of this once they realized how I had been mislead, and how the refurbishment was done poorly). When I contacted MyWit for a replacement, they said they don't do replacements, but I could return the phone and buy a new one. Seems reasonable, except that the price was fluctuating every day and had increased between $20-$60 since I had purchased it.The phone works OK now that I got Apple to fix it, but just be aware this isn't actually Apple selling it, so it's a riskier buy. Go to Apple.com and look at their refurbished devices if you want to be sure your phone was properly refurbished.

The iPhone 7 I received doesn’t work.
","

  I was extremely excited to get my iPhone 7, but it turned out to be a very frustrating situation. I went through the process to start up the phone and get to the home screen. The first thing I tried was to put my SIM card into the phone, but it didn’t work. It searched for minutes only to say “No Service”. Then I tried using the camera app, but it glitched out every time I attempted to take a photo or record a video. I looked up the problem and the articles said to check Voice Memos to see if you get “Recording Failed - No audio devices found.” — unfortunately, I had this problem. The only good aspect to this phone was its look, nothing else. Overall, the phone is broke and unusable. I bought my phone from ElectroWireless; they ripped me off completely. I expected a working phone from the description, but instead I was shipped an exact opposite of it. I am very upset.

Not actually refurbished. Just sold as is.

  Device looks absolutely pristine. Functionally there are several issues. Battery life is quite poor and was clearly not replaced as part of the refurbishing process as I had anticipated which means I will need to pay for a replacement. The home button is extremely temperamental and works about every other time and every third or fourth time when attempting the double click feature. About Every tenth text notification will repeatedly chime until I actually open the text. Lots of little annoying things that I would not expect from a phone that had actually been refurbished. Pretty dissatisfied with advertising of product compared to actual functionality of product. I doubt this product was even serviced before being sold.Edit: included in my package was a slip of paper saying I could get a $10 amazon gift card for leaving an honest review. I followed the protocol and never received my gift card. This seller is pretty terrible. Will not use again.

  First iPhone 7 order  arrived on time, had no scratches or any cosmetic damage, IOS not up to date and device screen started pixeling, really pretty obvious, even though box indicated it was ""Refurbished"" and ""Rigourously Tested"", ""Updated with New Software"".  After much discussion with hard to understand Amazon support reps, I negotiated an immediate gift credit, since I paid via cash on a debit card, and thus ordered a replacement the same day, while the first was sent back to initial supplier (DealFisher),  (Otherwise Amazon returns menu note suggested it would have taken 7 days to get credit).Second iPhone arrived a few days later from BUYSPRY, sooner than expected. It had a few very small nicks on the metal case, and nearly invisible hairline scratches on screen corner, and was not up to date on IOS, but did update. Seems to perform well so far (2 days in use) as expected after activating. Battery showed 85% capacity on IOS Beta Battery Health, but seems to hold a charge all day. Will give it a try and see what happens, have 30 days to return and 90 days warranty. Also, purchased 2 year square trade warranty.

Multiple Issues
","

  In less than a month of receiving the phone, the side silence button/switch broke. I called customer service and besides the fact that the agent was very unfriendly and seemed confused as to why I would call about a defected product instead of going to get it fixed myself. She said I could return it for a refund. That would obviously leave me without a phone so I decided to wait and see if I could get it fixed at a shop for cheap (update: it's not a cheap fix). Now two months into having the phone, the phone randomly restarted overnight and became locked again. After calling my carrier, they (and a local phone store) said that the phone's contract must have expired overnight and the phone was turned off...so the phone wasn't actually fully unlocked. I keep trying to call customer service but even when I leave a message (as told to do so when the lines are busy), no one gets back to me. It's been a headache.UPDATE: I changed it up to three stars from one star. After one customer service agent saying they were simply too busy to talk on the phone and trying to explain what the problem was and how to fix it despite me telling them that I had already tried that and it didn't work, another customer service agent called me and told me they'd issue me a refund and then ship it back with a prepaid label after I was able to find a new phone. The phone did work with TMobile, as mentioned by other users, though the fact that the button broke less than a month after I received it was still frustrating. I do appreciate the last customer service agent's help.

First generation iPhone 7 refurbished

  So I’ve bought a refurbished phone before but at times you end up unlucky with them and this was the case for me. I came back from Europe to lose my iPhone 6s. Straight up disappeared and I wa alike alright it’s strsight no worries, it’s just a phone. Till you realize you have everythinggg in your phone. Anyway I ordered the 128 gb iPhone 7 for only 315. It came in the mail within a couple of days. The moment I booted it up w/a SIM card the message popped up “cellular update failure” so my phone wouldn’t receive texts or etc. it disappeared after an hour so I was like okay no worries! It popped up again and stayed liked that for 2 days after so I sent in to apple for a diagnosis. They said that the first generation iPhones when upgraded to ios12.1 SOMEHOW the SIM card doesn’t come in contact the cellular module which doesn’t allow for connection? They mentioned something with soldering too might be weak but yeah. Only the first generation iPhone 7 have this issue. Ended up buying the iPhone XR 🤷‍♂️

Buyer beware...
","

  I've bought two of these, but not for a good reason... the first one I got from a seller named BuySPRY and unfortunately it looks like they don't repair the phones they work on correctly. I didn't really take concern about this until after I spilled a glass of water on my table, some of which went onto the phone. These phones are rated IP67 water resistant, but this particular phone repaired by BuySPRY was not properly sealed.If you do a little research you find these phones require you to remove all the old adhesive between the phone screen and the phone chassis and install a fresh new one; this is one of the primary things maintaining water resistance among a few other details. Anyway this phone clearly had not had its screen adhesive replaced, there was chunks of it exposed going around the edges of the screen - which left just enough of a gap for water to ingress.The big sad thing here is this happened I'm not kidding one day after the 90 warranty ended. I contacted the seller to inform them of the problem and asked if they could do anything. They didn't at all seem concerned their phone wasn't repaired correctly, nor did they offer any form of compensation for their poorly repaired device.So I ended up buying a new one, from a different seller named Hybrid IT. It has been over a month now and I so far have had a good experience. The first phone I got had a poor health battery as indicated in iPhone battery information. I contacted the seller about it; and they immediately corrected the problem. They sent me another phone which has a 100% battery. So far this phone has been perfect and I haven't had any issues with it. I also can clearly see the screen adhesive looks like it is brand new. Hopefully this one will hold out.Moral to the story, if you at all find anything concerning with your purchase of an Amazon renewed phone... don't hesitate, don't take chances... get them to make it right. Some of us are more picky than others, but my main concerns on repaired phones are the water tight seal and the health of the battery. It is going to be very difficult to find a perfect condition used phone, so you have to pick what you care about most. Good luck!

Phone would not connect to cellular service

  The phone was beautiful!  My daughter loaded her apps and contacts onto the phone, connected it to WiFi, and was excited to start using the phone.  She could access some apps, such as FaceTime, but only while on WiFi.  The phone would not connect to cellular data.  When she took it to Verizon, she was told that the iPhone 7 is notorious for having this problem.  We've had the phone 24hrs now and MyWit quickly issued a RMA.  I would have rather exchanged the phone but that was not an option.  I looked at the MyWit inventory and the phone was available for sale, but it was more expensive.  So, it's now 1 week until Christmas and my $320 is tied up with MyWit until they issue a refund (2-3 days after receipt) which means she won't have a Christmas present.  -_-Update:  Phone sent back today.  The RMA / return label were confusing though.  On the instructions, it says the ""return address"" isATTN: Amazon Sales3640 Sandhurst DriveSuite AYork, PA 17406However, the return label is addressed to a Lewisville Texas address.* I'll update again after MyWit receives the phone.

Worth the price
","

  This phone is definitely worth the price. My phone came looking brand new without a scratch on the screen or the back. I know that some other people have reviewed phones that have come with scratches all over them, but mine wasn’t like that. It also has all the buttons and systems working perfectly, including the fingerprint reader. That being said because of the price that means you have to make a few compromises. My battery health is only at 85% so the battery does not last as long as a brand new phone(only about 5 hours), but it still lasts pretty well for me. Also the camera shutter sound cannot be disabled on my phone and that may be because my phone is from Korea or Japan where the shutter sound cannot be disabled. I thought that my phone would be coming with a lightning cord power adapter(dongle?) like other Apple phones because the wording in the description was a little confusing, but instead it came with a different cord. It also does not come with headphones so so I had to buy them separate. My phone also came about a week later than expected but I think that was more to blame on the mail shipping service. I would say that as long as you are willing to make some compromises for the price that this phone is worth it. I felt a little nervous buying a pre-owned phone without seeing it first and felt like it was a little bit of a gamble, but it was worth the risk.

  I just got it for two hours, so the review would be changed after a couple of days using.1. It is pre-owned. no scratch, but wear can be seen around the back camera, speaker and mute button.2. The model is A1779, which is a Japanese version. Due to the Japanese law, it cannot be mute (even you turn off the sound) when taking photos... it really annoying me, it is a basic requirement in my mind... I really did not expect Amazon would ship me a Japanese version... so -1 star.3. The battery is not healthy. It shows 79% maximum capacity in the battery report. Compares to my own IPhone7+ which has been used for almost years, it is 86%. so -1 star.4. Extremely hot...

  This phone looks new and the battery is phenomenal. Popped in my T Mobile sim and it was ready to rock and roll. Everything about this phone has been as expected EXCEPT the screen. Sometimes it works perfectly, but about half the time it does not. It doesn’t recognize the correct location where touching the screen. For example, I’ll try typing a word but it’ll recognize keystrokes from the other side of the keyboard. If I lock and unlock the screen a few times it will act normally.  I cannot find out how to reach their tech support.

  A couple thoughts on this item. I received it a day early than expected so the shipping was great. It didn't come in an original iPhone box however it wasn't damaged in any way. The condition was perfect. I was pretty happy with it. Put in a Verizon sim and it picked up the Verizon network pretty much immediately. Then put it on charge to charge up and updated the operating system.This is when things went south. The battery ran super hot when charging. A lot more hot than normal. I then tried typing in the phone's IMEI number into Verizon's website and was told that the phone is not compatible with Verizon. I did this more than once just to make doubly sure I had typed it in correctly.I then tried to make a call. The call quality was terrible. At times it was impossible to hear anything. It didn't matter if the call was on speaker or not. I tried restarting the phone and got pretty much the same result. When trying to make a call, it spoke a lot about roaming. This was key. I turned the roaming option off and tried again. Still talking about roaming.This phone was not 100% unlocked. It was probably locked to a network such as AT&T or T-Mobile at some stage, however it lacks the antenna which will allow it to connect to other networks such as Verizon or Sprint. A phone which is 100% unlocked will have antenna built into it which support all the networks making it a fully unlocked phone. The phone did pick up Verizon, however that was based on roaming on some other network and not by connecting directly to any Verizon tower in my area.A fully unlocked phone would have shown on Verizon's website that the IMEI number was compatible with their network. It would have also come back as being compatible with AT&T's network as well as T-Mobile and Sprint. It would have saved me time and money if the IMEI number was checked by the seller as to whether it was compatible with the Verizon network instead of running an unlock code on the phone and then marketing it as being fully unlocked.I checked the IMEI number. It came back clean however it does show that it comes from a phone which has 128 GB of storage. This phone has 32 GB of storage, so somewhere there is a discrepancy. I suspect the phone may have been made up from parts from various phones.I sent the phone back.

  Perfect phone, unlocked and works with t-mobile. battery, no marks and functions exactly as it should. One complaint is that the previous user did not fully clear the phone. Their Apple ID keeps showing up here and there and I just try to ignore it.

Good quality for the price

  Ordered an unlocked 128gb iPhone 7, looks great with no scratches at all, there is a VERY small bump on the back but you can NOT notice it. Everything works great as it should. The only reason I gave this a 4 and not a 5 is because the battery health is at 85% though it says there's nothing wrong with it. Either way for the price, I got what I needed and it was a great buy. I would recommend this instead of paying close to $500 for a new one.

  I just received this phone today and its pretty good although it was very dirty on the back of the phone and all the features seem to be working just fine also it doesn't come with the original box. It comes with the apple USB cord though, but I'm dissatisfied that it didn't come with the apple charging box and instead it came in a random white box with a random box charger. I'm still happy with the phone but for 300$ it's not worth for no other utensils except the actual USB cord. Hope it hep!!😁👍

  I completely love the phone the iphone 7 works great, comes unlocked like they said i live in latin america and works excelent, its seems almost like new with no scratches or smashes for be an refurbished one. The battery comes with a 92% of battery health (maximun capacity) is excelent. The only bad thing and is the reason why i not give five stars to the product is that have a small gray dot in the camera that appears when i took a picture with the back camera is very very small but is a little uncomfortable, it is still an amazing product.

  Overall a great product. Came in almost perfect condition with a glass screen protector already on it. I did have to get the battery replaced, no big deal.

I was able to get it replaced as well though and I have a perfect working phone.

  This iPhone 7 matte black was a good purchase for me because my old phone was slow and battery would run out fast but with this iPhone it seems to last me the whole day of usage without charging it back but theres two problems first the fingerprint doesn’t work so good it took me a while to set up because it would say an error and second of all when I wanted to put it to charge, it wouldn’t charge unless I fixed its position but overall I can fix those miner problems and it was worth it.

It won’t NOT click

  I bought this iPhone for my daughter because spending $700 to $800 on something a teenager will shove in their back pocket, sit on, drop, and generally destroy is completely foolish. She's had it a few weeks now and everything seems to work fine, except there does not seem to be a way to mute the click of the camera. Muting and turning the volume all the way down don't work. You have no idea how annoying it gets when you can't turn it off.

  I’ve seen a lot of bad reviews for this phone based on issues with the seller. Granted, some of those reviews say it took a few weeks for the problems to appear so I’ll edit this if that happens, but wow was I happy with what I got. Not only did it come with a charger (there’s some debate on that in other reviews), but it even had a clear bumper case. That was neither expected nor necessary but I appreciated it (I bought a Unicorn Beetle case which I have used and loved before on other phones). There wasn’t a scratch on this phone and it started working right away for me. The battery seems to be holding up fine. All in all I’d say this seems like a steal. If it self destructs on me in the next few weeks I’ll update this.UPDATE: It's been a few months and a trip overseas since I wrote that initial review, and it remains a solid decision I'm very happy with.

So Much Better Than What I Expected

  This arrived 2 DAYS after I ordered it. It came much earlier than expected which is amazing! I see many reviews that say it isn't compatible with different networks but it worked perfectly when I activated it with Sprint. And despite its price it works great!

Exceeded expectations, great value for price, & Amazon Renewed Guaranteed!
","

  It can sometimes be risky purchasing refurbished phones, but after doing my research I come to this product page and ordered the Rose Gold - iPhone 7 128GB from MyWit. Also trust and loved that this purchased is backed by the Amazon renewed program, so if there were any issues, I will be supported for up to 90-days after purchase.As expected, the phone arrived in non-Apple packaging with no headphones. What I was not expecting was that it also came with the Apple charging brick and cable. The phone looked GREAT, with no scratches (I would have been OK with minor scratches since I am purchasing something refurbished) and no cracks/smooth front screen. The only little, temporary, issue I saw was a little dust in the speakers/mic holes at the bottom of phone. It was a simple fix, I simply clean the area with a brush and the phone looked exactly like new! Tested phone calls on loudspeaker and the speakers work fine!I have used the phone for a while now and it continues to work beautifully. This iPhone 7 came with iOS 12 running out of the box, which was fine by me. Even checked the battery health with the new iOS and it was at 89% (very fair, actually expected something lower).Your experience (packaging, phone condition, etc) may not be exactly the same as mine since each phone is different, but this was definitely a great purchase for the price. Definitely be open-minded if you are interested in a refurbished phone and be OK if the phone does not arrive 100% in perfect condition.This is my personal review, I will update this review if anything else changes!

  I recieved this phone the next day after ordering and it came today just as expected. Doesn't come in orginal box or with any of the adapters and headphones but it comes with a sim card slot tool and an off brand charger. You can get lightning adapters and other accesories cheap online anyway, I got mine for $10 and a glass screen protector and Popsocket to go with my new phone. It's unlocked, I have Straight Talk and got my service up and running with the phone activation kit and kept my old number and everything. Appearence wise it's in perfect condition, no scratches, dents or issues. Started up immediately with half battery life. Would reccomend this product if you want a $150 discount as opposed to buying new from Apple.

  This phone looks and performs like it's brand new. Not one scratch. The phone came with a screen protector and a charger. I was surprised as other reviews said they did not get one. For $269, I feel like this was a steal, compared to other listings. Hopefully nothing goes wrong with the phone later. But with the Amazon 90 day guarantee I'm a little more at ease. Never bought a refurbished phone before. Not sure what to expect. As far as my order, I am happy with it.

  I bought this for my grandma since she needed an upgrade (she had the iPhone 5) this was the best price and value I could fine. When I got it, it looked brand new no scratches no issues whatsoever. All I had to do was switch over the SIM cards and just back up her old phone to her computer then just transfer everything to this phone. She absolutely loves it. Incase anyone wants to know it comes with a new charger and wall plug and a SIM card removal tool and that is it no headphones. Those are sold separately with this unless you purchase straight from Apple.  Only buy this phone if you have AT&T and this phone can’t be used for other carries it specifically says in a note card that comes with the phone

  My phone arrived in great condition.  There are no scratches on the glass, and there is no visible wear and tear on the case.  It works perfectly.  I inserted my carrier-provided SIM card in the SIM tray and it was immediately available on AT&T's network.A SIM tray key was included in the box along with protective plastic covers for the screen.  A charging cable and standard outlet plug were also included in the box.This version of the iPhone does not have a headphone jack.  I did not receive a headphone insert in the box, but (#1) I don't need one as all of my headphones are Bluetooth and (#2) I don't know if Apple included this in the original packaging so this is just a courtesy note for potential buyers of the iPhone 7, not a complaint.The seller contacted me after I received my phone to make sure I was happy with the purchase and I am.

Why Would Anyone Want This?
","

  Why would anyone want a phone like this?  I’ve had a number of flip phones from Tracfone—Motorola, LG, Alcatel—and every one of them was superior to this thing.  The physical design of the phone is square, large, and clunky so that it does not fit comfortably in your pocket or your hand.  I might have lived with this, but the basic functions of the phone are unintuitive.  Experience with prior Tracfone devices from the companies mentioned above did not help me in figuring out how to enter numbers into the phone book or set up an ICE number.  I guess unlike most people today I don’t expect much from a cell phone, but even so this LG product completely failed to satisfy my minimal phone needs.  I replaced it with an Alcatel A405DL which seems so far to be a night and day improvement.

Decent Flip - And Here Are Some Tips
","

  Since this has no keyboard, here are some tips for typing text, navigating, etc:From the front screen, press the 'SEND' button to see the list of recent calls and get the menu options for this list.From the front screen, press and hold ""1"" to call voicemail. Or, dial *86. Once you have called voicemail (and set it up, for a new phone), you can also add it as a 'Contact' from the list of recent calls.From any menu screen, press the ""CLR"" button to back up one menu level.From any menu screen, ""END"" pulls you entirely out of the menu and returns you to the front screen.Entering text:In some screens, ""END"" finishes the letter and moves you to the next letter to enter. In this mode, the '0' key doubles as ""next"".In other screens, such as entering a Contact's name, the key is a toggle for as long as the letter is highlighted. For example you want to enter the letter ""B"" -- press the '2' key, and an 'A' is showing, highlighted. Then immediately press the '2' key again until a 'B' is showing, then wait for a moment for the 'B' to no longer be highlighted. Then you are ready to enter the next letter.While entering text the ""CLR"" key is a backspace key you can used to erase the previous letter.While entering text, you can cursor to another letter before by using the left and right clickers in the ""ring"". Once you have placed the cursor after the letter you want to delete, press ""CLR"".

  All in all this is a great flip phone,read thru LG's user manual before buying. I did this and saw that this phone is capable of wifi calling however Tracphone cripples this feature and removes it from the wireless and network menu that Lg has in their user manual. Why? I guess Tracphone wants to squeeze a few more pennies from their customers and not allow any free calls over wifi. I can partially understand this but wifi calling is also good for those of us in a rural setting with poor cell-signal reception. I just think Tracphone should be a little more upfront about disabling this phones wifi calling ability.

  I have horrible luck with smartphones and when my last iPhone simply stopped working, I had had enough. I bought this phone a couple days ago and I am already in LOVE. Texting takes time, but the buttons are large enough that it's not difficult. Plus you can send emojis! I had my first phone call today and I was floored at the audio quality. I have a hard time understanding people over the phone, but it sounded so clear and loud that I could understand everything. It also doesn't heat up like my iPhone did when I talked on the phone. I actually enjoyed talking on the phone with this bad boy! It can take and send pictures that are of much better quality than I expected. It has an alarm too.a bit of advice: buy the service plan on the tracfone website!! it's cheaper than ordering it through amazon and it's instant (you don't have to wait for anything in the mail). you also don't need to order the sim card kit thing, you just need to order this phone and everything else is online!Overall, this thing has everything I wanted in a phone: it can text, call, take photos and has an alarm feature. it's easy to use and makes a satisfying click when I close it. It has the ability to go online, but I haven't done that yet (i don't really need internet access on my phone). It's cheap and easy to use -- a month of service is only $16. If you're considering getting a flip phone, I can't recommend this one enough.

I can move it around a bit but so far unable to retrieve the card. The cellular SIM card seats snugly in the tray and functions properly.I want my SD card back!

No case available anywhere on the internet.  Is it really US phone?
","

  As the headline indicated, I cannot find a case for this exact model phone.  Any case shown online for this model has cutouts that will not fit the different shape of the camera lenses on the back, which is oblong, not round.  I suppose one could try to buy a case and try to modify it by cutting, but once the case is not actually for this exact model phone, you can’t know whether the sizes will match.  The phone without a case is extremely thin and thus, slippery.  Also, within one page of searching for this phone model (Moto g7 plus), almost all of the websites had foreign web domains.  It seems odd to indicate that this is a US phone but have nearly exclusively foreign links to it.  Perhaps a clue is that my previous “unlocked” Moto g6 was an international version and thus the warranty could not be applied when it bricked.  I suspect that unlocking is more universal in the rest of the world compared to the US, where phone companies are still infatuated with selling phones at a discount on contracts that make it difficult to change providers.

  model # xt1965-t or basically the tmobile revvlry+.

Good phone for a good price
","

  I've been a fan of the Moto G series of phones for years, and this one does not disappoint.  Especially for the price (<$130 currently), I don't think you'll find a better deal out there. My only issue is with finding a case for this phone. Not sure if this is a newer, less common edition, but all of the G7+ cases I've found are for the other version with a round rear camera, not an ""oblong"" one like this version. If I can find a case this phone will be 5 stars, otherwise it will probably end up cracked shortly! Update: the battery life is pretty horrible if you are actually using the phone, but it charges quickly and I'm usually near a charger so it's not that big of a deal to me most of the time.

  Excellent phone for general use.  Bought for  my wife for calls, emails, text, watching videos.  Battery life seems OK for these purposes and recharges very quickly.  Purchased an inexpensive case on Amazon.  Has circular camera cut out but oval lens fits perfectly within the oval.  All other controls, speakers fit perfectly.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WHLX6DJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Have had trouble with previous phone dropping calls.

Different from other G7 Plus

  I am quite happy with the phone for the price paid. Was trying to find a case for it, then realized this model is different from other G7 Plus you can find online. This one, I suspect is a newer version of G7 Plus, has oblong shaped rear camera and finger print reader. You might want to double check for compatibility before you order a case. This version also has NFC.

  BUT burns through battery life within 2 hours of use from 100% to 67% watching YouTube videos, great stereo sound, BUT get a case, ANY case, as its surrounded by Gorilla glass 3, so its impossible to hold without dropping it. A;so WATCH the price on here, literally hourly it changes from $119.22-$226.20 and back down. Its a premium phone but if you get it on sale, just buy two for the price of one. Its best to have a spare and it comes loaded with new Android 10.

Accepts micro SD, no protective cases available
","

  Five stars because the price is right. The description neglected to mention that it accepts a micro SD card which is great for those of us who don't use the cloud. Bought this December 2020 so it's a bit too early for me to give an honest review of the phone but I did have a comment about the availability of protective cases available for this phone. Amazon offers many cases that claim to fit Moto G7 ""PLUS"" however this is not accurate. G7 ""PLUS"" has an oblong camera port on the back while every case that Amazon offers for G7 ""PLUS"" has a round hole which does not allow the case to sit flat against the back of the ""PLUS"" (Learned that the hard way) Beware you may not be able to find a case for this phone without modifying it.

  I really like the size and feel of this phone, not too heavy, not too small. It feels really fast and fluid.I put my T-Mobile SIM card in and it was recognized in my account as a Tmobile branded Revvlry+. It even has the magenta color power button, it looks like all Moto changed was the logo on the back.The G7+ case I got works but doesn't quite sit flat at the camera bump. I've ordered another case that's specifically labeled for the Revvlry+.Battery life seems fine so far, but I don't play games or watch much video, just web and a couple apps.It came with Android 10 already installed. There's an NFC switch in the menu. It also has face recognition unlock, although it doesn't work well in low light. Fingerprint sensor works fine.

  The description clearly says the the phone is in near 100 percent condition cosmetically and was tested by a “Amazon certified” retailer who is not Apple certified...when I opened the package to inspect the iPhone, there’s tons of scratches on the front and back including a large scratch like someone took a knife across it. There was good size chip on the corner, the battery is beyond shot and the Bluetooth refuses to stay connected. I also went on Apple.com to see the trade in value, because of its condition, they suggest it’s time to recycle even though the Amazon retailer states its close to 100 percent cosmetically when in reality it’s more like 40 percent.

Not a great choice unless you are really into Apple products
","

  I have always (30 years now) chosen non-Apple phones before.  Ios phones when they became available.  I decided this time around that I wanted something a bit cheaper and I liked some of the features that I read about in the reviews.  The big shock came in all of the things that NOBODY ever mentions.  Like the fact that it is really difficult to move photos from the computer to the iPhone.  Or that, no matter what you do, when you connect your iPhone to your computer to download a photo, all the photos you have taken show up.  You cannot simply navigate to a neat little album to find what you want.  If you want the photo you just took, you need to scroll all the way to the bottom of the list.  Hiding the photos doesn't do it.  You would think that putting the photos you want it an album would get them out of the way of the root photo directory.  Nope.  Doesn't work that way.  Every photo will show up every time.Another real annoyance is the actual phone directory.  No speed dial.  You can put some people in a favorites list so you have a shorter list, but you still have to scroll the list, you can't just open the phone app and press the number for your sweetie.Some of the utilities are pretty cool: a compass, a measuring device, and an easy way to record voice memos.  These all work as well as you would hope.  The Notes app is also very convenient.  As with any electronics device there is way more pressure to add apps that will track you and steal details of your life, but mostly you can see what they are and say no.I find the calendar is also not quite as nice as the calendar in my old Samsung.  It is not very flexible in allowing me to set appointments for, say, every other week.I wouldn't buy another one, but that might be true of an apple fan looking at an Ios system, too.

  I bought the phone in Oct. 2020 and ended up never activating service because of a defect that prevented me from porting over my old number from another carrier. After two phone calls with Tracfone in the past two months, I still continue to receive charges of $15.96 per month for air time on a phone that is not operational and that doesn't receive any cell service.I cannot stress this enough: Do not buy this phone. Do not buy air time minutes.If you're strapped for cash, buy a prepaid wireless phone from one of the bigger carriers, then call and ask them to unlock it. You might have to pay a fee or wait up to a year, but it will still save you the hassle I'm going through right now. Switch your number over to another low-cost carrier that won't steal money out of your bank account.

Some phones are problematic
","

  Bought 3 phones for the famiy, 2 are ok the 3rd has been a problem since activation.  My husband just uses his for emergencies and his is the problem.  When it was activated by tracfone, his phone number and account info from his old tracfone were successfully transferred over but there have been many problems he is not happy about.  They activated the voice mail without his ok and now it cannot be removed.  Also the caller ID is not working right.  3 days have been spent trying to solve these problems but eveyone is incompetent. Reason for the 2 stars.The other 2 phones seem good for basic use. The caller ID and voice mail are not issues. Will meet our needs.

Phone is fine, service and support are lacking
","

  I don't have any real problems with the phone itself.  My mediocre review is because of the nightmare process of setting this up with tracfone.  I've been with tracfone for years and have mine, and my two sons' phones on it.  My wife was finally ready to move from another carrier.  So, I got this phone after doing research and it seemed like a good deal.  On Amazon, it comes bundled with 30 days of unlimited service for the same price as the phone alone on tracfone's site.  Got the phone in a couple of days, but I could not set it up on tracfone's site the way I have done for all my other phones.  The annoying thing is that I got no messages or feedback.  I enter the information, hit Continue, and NOTHING.  So, I got on a chat session, and a mere 3.5 hours later, the phone was working.  Except for texting.  Why would voice and data work and not text?  Well, they had to get a better tech support person to call me back a half hour later.  Finally, after another hour on the phone with this guy (where I could hear roosters crowing behind him) texting finally worked.  Well, we didn't realize until the next day that SMS worked for texting, but MMS did not work for group texts and images.  So, back on another chat session for 30 minutes, then another call back, then another hour on the phone, and it's still not working.  So far, 15% of my 30 days have been spent without all the features I am paying for.  My wife uses group text quite a bit, and currently can't do it.  Tracfone says they opened a ticket with Verizon, the underlying carrier, but I don't expect much.  They told me Verizon would call within 3 days, and it's been 2, and nothing so far.  Occasionally restarting the phone in the mean time, as suggested by the tech person, has not helped.  I have searched and read forums where others have this problem and while some people have fixed it, none of the fixes have worked for me.UPDATE: After the 72 hours they told me to wait for Verizon to get back to me, I checked the ticket online, and saw it was closed.  Verizon had done nothing, and it wasn't even clear that Verizon had been contacted.  Obviously no call back from the, or Tracfone.  Placed yet another call to check on the ticket, was told the ticket did not exist.  Immediately escalated it, and after about another hour on runaround the phone, I finally found the one competent tech who was actually able (within 10 minutes of starting our conversation) had recognized what the issue was and fixed it.  So, six days after getting the phone, and six hours on chat and calls, the phone is finally fully functional.

Not great for die hard seniors!

  I just needed a phone to call my family and a few other places.  I hate the premise of these phones that think you need to shop and do other computer stuff and get lots of advertisements from all the vultures out there who want your money, not to mention tracking where you are, where your going, what you think and what your interests are.  If you can figure out how and what to turn off so that the phone won't try to type everything you say. and not have a stroke in the process, then this phone will probably work for you.

  The charger doesn't work. There doesn't seem to be any way to contact Tracfone to get them to replace the charger. I have other chargers but it is best to use the manufacturer's charger for a device. Tracfone, send me a working charger and I will change this to a 5 star review.

Tracfone backup or replacement phone.
","

  I use Tracfone, so despite this being locked to Tracfone, it is not a deal breaker.On the contrary, it is a good buy for less than $40. It does things well for the fact that it is limited to 2 Gig RAM and 16G ROM. I wish it had more, but I don't want to pay more money. With such limitations, I only keep a bare minimum of apps relating to call VoIP.For people that want more from an everyday phone, I suggest they buy a better version of Mot.I like the fact that thus phone is absolutely free of bloatware. This is in part due to Tracfone business philosophy.I will forever keep this phone as a backup until 4G is no longer viable 10 years from now.

Simple Smartphone Staple
","

  Honestly, it seems like everyday, we do need to pickup our smartphones for all our lives. For myself, I have liked using my smartphones, but found myself in need of a different one, after my unlocked phone crashed & burned. I have been Tracfone customer since 2016, and never left since then. But for myself, just because I have a good cell phone plan, I need the right phones for it. That was a surprise to me, when I saw the Motorola Moto E6. While it isn't 5G ready, it feels like it is. This phone is fast and runs smoothly on the Android 9 system, without many hiccups. It is a simple smartphone that does the trick well. While I did find it tougher to install some of my apps on the smartphone, because they were not being recognized, I still managed well. This smartphone is a good buy for anyone that has yet to own a one. I suggest you go pick this one up.Price: BConvenience & Setup: B 1/2-Overall: B

Inexpensive ""smart phone"" thinks it's smarter than I am.
","

  For me, even the best smart phone cannot replace a real computer - mostly because touch screens rarely get it right the first time. This may not be true for everyone else - but they can write their own reviews.This Moto E6 is mostly a step up from my last phone (LG Rebel).Pros:+ Low price ($30). I can't understand why any cell phone is worth more than $100.+ Tracfone is still the best value in cell phone service. Roughly $125 for a year of service ($10 per month). While there are limits for the number of calls and texts, I never come close to running  out. And the data limit is irrelevant because for data, I use a real computer.+The phone instantly displays the time, date and battery condition when I move the phone.+ This Moto E6 has an built in app that displays the time, date and weather conditions on the home screen.+ The amount of internal storage (16 GB) is double that of my old phone.+ The screen size is big enough for a device that is always with me (fits in my pocket).+ Processor seems fast enough+ Battery life is good (for my use, a charge is good for more than 2 days).Complaints:- Too many ( over 40) built in Moto and Android  (Google) apps.  Some of these can be disabled, but they come back when I restart the phone (Yes I power off my phone regularly).- I preferred the power button location on my old LG Rebel.

  Great value for an Android phone but no service plan is included. If you'd like to develop on Android or just like to get a great value on what is essentially a miniature tablet, this is a great item.  The performance is very good and the rear camera is an exceptional 13 MP (front camera is 5 MP). It's a cost-reduced phone, so there's no fingerprint scanner and the glass can get kind of smeared.Note that this Tracfone runs on Verizon's CDMA 4G LTE networks, but only runs with Tracfone SIM cards. You may unlock it 12 months after activation.

Great For My 14 Year old!

  What a wonderful little phone! I purchased this as a starter phone for a younger family member. We set it up in minutes, freed up some space by removing some of the games (from what I'm told, no one under 20 plays solitaire or word games) but added a few aps for news, current events and videos. Tracfone has a no contract option and a way for a young teen to keep track of use, (although we purchased unlimited talk and text). Switching back and forth between wifi use is a breeze. Can't believe how responsive the phone is. Camera is great, but not using for high end work... storage is limited but we'll work with it. Call quality is good, speakers for music a little off, but my 14 year old isn't listening to Bach.  Affordable and everyone is happy right out of the box! Now I want one!

Steer clear of TracFone
","

  I've been with TracFone for years. Never had a problem switching my phone number to a new TracFone until now. I bought the LG Journey, to upgrade from my older LG. Have tried for several days to get my phone number switched to the new LG phone. First, I tried to activate the new phone online with TracFone. I followed all the steps correctly. After 2 days, my old phone was still active. I tried to activate online again. This time, the old phone deactivated but the new phone did not activate. I subsequently called Tracfone several times. They completely lost the balance on my account, I had to give them an estimate of what that was. After 2 factory resets and other things TracFone did to try to get my new phone to work, I still get the message that my number is restricted whenever I try to make a call. I now have a call set up with both TracFone and Verizon. If that doesn't resolve the issue I am changing to another carrier. There is no excuse for this. If I could give zero, or negative stars for this review, I would. TracFone used to be a decent company. Not any more. Stay far, far away from TracFone.

Nice hardware but one of the worst user interfaces makes it highly frustrating to use
","

  The hardware is very good, except for the disposable style non-removable battery. (When the battery dies 2-3 years down the road so does the phone). The screen is crisp and bright. The sad thing is that even the best hardware unappreciated when its software is faulty.The software side is an abysmal failure. UI very frustrating to use. Despite having disabled the autocorrect feature plus trying both available software touchpad keyboard options the phone keeps ""correcting"" your text, including commonly used abbreviations like ""thx"", and it often ends up making you either unintelligible or embarrassing you like you are a total nitwit.Other general usability is cumbersome and inefficient. My last phone (Luna J3 samsung) was just all around much more pleasant to use. This phone is also noticeably heavier and longer than the Luna, so it won't really fit in your shirtpocket.  Maybe that's a good thing though, as that's how the Luna met its demise, flying out of a shirtpocket into the sidewalk. Battery life is mediocre despite having a heavy large capacity internal battery. My Luna lasted days longer on a full charge despite having a lighter smaller battery. It also takes longer to charge the battery.I'm still semi-satisfied because at this price, $20, it's maybe the best ultra-budget option out there. I just use it as a minimal use phone and learn to tolerate the poor txt-ing experience.

I was hoping to use this Brick as a home phone with Bluetooth connections to a Panasonic handheld set with multiple hand sets. When finally able to connect it would work until the phone call ended and then would self disconnect. Will not satisfy my needs so am returning it. It might be OK for a pocket phone without expecting the bells and whistles to work. Also, the Home Screen, when phone is open is very difficult to read and is not clear. Fuzzy icons and color scheme is like a toy. I would not waste time nor money on this substandard basic telephone.

Dropped once and screen immediately shattered

  I am with T-mobile. Although the product description states it is an unlocked phone it appears that it is not. I took it into my neighborhood T-mobile store and they installed a new SIM card. It would not connect. They were the ones that told me it appears to be locked to AT&T. I had originally contacted Plum support for assistance, they got back to me in a day. They told me that all I had to do was change the SIM card.  After this was attempted and failed, I went to T-mobile for assistance. I have contacted Plum support again and let them know  my situation. I asked them for any other information that would allow me to use the phone.  I let them know if they had none, I need information on how to return it.Before I made the purchase read the reviews. Only one that I read mentioned that it was not an unlocked phone. Be careful.

Not worth it
","

  I had to upgrade from my 2G flip phone that I've had for 8 years and paid $9.99.  I was really hoping this phone would be a little more sophisticated without being too complicated.  Unfortunately as other reviewers have noted, the manual is severely lacking in any kind of operating instructions.  I have no idea how to use most of the features other than the very basic.  The texting features just plain suck.  The ""smart"" in put only gives you one or two choices and I can't for the life of me get it to save new words.  It's either all caps or all lowercase, no option to use both at once unless you're typing in letter by letter.  There's no way to change the volume of a call unless you're ON a call...there's no dedicated speaker button...you can't see the screen unless you flip the phone open; my old phone had a feature that let you press the external volume button so you could see the outside display.  This is without a doubt the most frustrating piece of technology I've dealt with.  I don't think I can return it at this point, so $69 down the tubes.  I'm going to go get another cheap flip and toss this one.

Bad technology

  I know its just a flip phone but it should be able to do at least 2 things: Call and text. You can not save word to the internal dictionary when texting with this  (customer support flippantly tells me) AND it seems to be missing about half the common English words one would use in the ""Smart"" mode. So you end up having to click two or three times per letter to type those words out. Do yourself a favor and research that before you bother with things like this.... I do like the rugged nature of it. It also has no calculator or calendar. It kinds sucks....

Phenomenal  Basic Phone AAAA+

  Finally, a manufacturer that gets it. GREAT volumes, keypad is very well laid out, simple to use for us that are mainly interested in calls and sms. Setup was a breeze, ( except using the sim adaptor from nano to full sizes a little tricky). Build quality is perfect and seems very durable. Call quality using ATT towers on Consumer Cellular is perfect. Only caveat is mms which doesn't seem to work, possible because its not 4g but for us brief sms users, it really doesn't matter. After all, the camera and screen size aren't really designed to view pictures etc. although you certainly can if you want to squint. Im not sure why there are negative reviews for this devise unless the expectations were other than the product description. All I can say is if you want a phone for calls and the occasional sms this is absolutely perfect. If you need multimedia, web browsing, email, professional quality pics, look elsewhere, I don't think this phone was designed with you in mind. One last thing, I have read the complaints about the lack of exterior volume controls. In my experience, that leads to inadvertently changing the ringer volumes etc. if you keep this phone in your pocket. You have to open the phone to answer the call anyway and I much prefer using the multifunction button to control volumes rather than constantly readjusting the volumes.

Expandable storage is NOT FOR APPS
","

  Critical limitation for anyone looking to buy this phone. Adding storage with a SD card is only for pictures, music, documents -- you can NOT use the SD storage for apps.After all the Samsung bloat updates, you only really have ~6GB for apps, and once it's full, that's it. No more apps. So you have to pick the 5 or 10 apps you really want to use. Doesn't matter how big of an SD card you put in.The ability to ""merge"" a fast SD card with your internal storage has been a standard feature of Android since 2015, with Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Yet Samsung has deliberately disabled that stock feature on its phones. You can only format your SD card to ""portable storage"" and not ""adoptable storage"". (There were workarounds to enable adoptable storage on older Galaxy phones like the S7 but none of them have worked for me on the A01.)It's a shame, because otherwise, this phone really raises the bar for ""entry level"" phones for ~$50 (less if you catch a sale). It mostly looks and feels like a ""real"" Galaxy phone. The Snapdragon 439 can provide a low mid-tier experience, if you don't mind it chugging sometimes. The animations are usually fluid, if a bit syrupy, and it's modestly competent at basic usage.I would rate a 32GB version at 5-stars for what it offers at this price point, or if Samsung didn't block Android's built-in ""adoptable storage"" feature. But avoid the 16GB version unless you don't use many apps.

Manufacture One plus  denies manufacture warranty- Fake Advertisement
","

  I bought this phone for my husband for his birthday- the speaker is so low that you can barely listen and the battery started to warm up after using for 2 months. I contacted amazon and they connected me to One Plus. After two 40 minute LONG CALLS,  the One plus customer rep denies to replace the NEW phone since I bought it on AMAZON which is selling PRIME SELLING PARTNER. They denied the replacement of new phone, suggested that they will repair with no future guarantee. My husband has had One plus for 5 years and this is how to they treat there loyal customer. The amazon representative was very nice she tried to help. THERE IS NO WHERE ONE PLUS MENTIONED THAT MANUFACTURE WARRANTY IS DIFFERENT WHEN YOU BUY FROM AMAZON - VERY DISAPPOINTED

You Get What You Pay For
","

  When I first received this phone I thought it was for me. It is really fast and doesn't have a great camera but thats fine with me. That's why it's a few hundred less. Just to be upfront, I use Verizon prepay on the phone. I have had so many cell issues but I think it's related to one plus. The phone calls random people while I'm on a call. I can't activate visual voicemail. Numerous times I would hear my phone ringing but nothing would pop up to prompt me to answer. Just listened to it ring while looking at my home screen.  It's possible it works smoother on other carriers but it is extremely glitchy in my experience. I just ordered an S20 for a couple hundred more.

MMS/SMS problems
","

  Screen and camera are beautiful, although I do occasionally have response issues at the edge of the screen. My reason for 2 stars is an issue with the OS I believe, SMS and MMS are a MAJOR short fall with this phone. MMS does not work and SMS is hit and miss, which is pretty major considering this is a mobile phone and that's one of the main things it should do. The only thing OnePlus could tell me is that eventually there should be an update to fix it...so until then I have to use other 3rd party apps to send messages, its incredibly annoying.LOVE LOVE LOVE the camera though, it's the only thing saving this phone from 1 star right now.***Update 8/13 I HATE this phone I'm so frustrated with the touchscreen issues, it is legit ruining my life. I have a $1000 freaking camera that makes me want to set myself on fire every time it I'm TYPING in an app and in .2 seconds click click somehow I'm back on my home screen??? UGH, some serious OS issues here.

Disappointing flagship
","

  Disappointed in the quality of this one.  I had a oneplus5 that I loved, so I decided to upgrade to the flagship oneplus phone.Screen is very fragile.  The phone fell out of my pocket when I was sitting down at my desk.  It fell about 18in and the screen cracked.  Normally I would tough it out with a cracked screen, but this phone was literally unusable.  After the screen was cracked, the screen would not turn on.  I've cracked phones and observed other cracked phones and I've never seen one that has behaved in this way.Oneplus support is totally unhelpful.  I sent my phone in for repairs and they did not investigate the screen issue.  They just sent me a bill on the screen and did not comment on the unusable screen issue.  I tried talking to support to find out the issue on the unusable screen and they just repeated something to the tune of ""but your screen was cracked"" ad nauseam.If I had to do it again, I wouldn't buy this phone.

  Device is super fast. No issue with the network. Too many issues with the compass and GPS. If you frequent user of GPS, don’t buy this device. Navigation goes crazy when using on this device. Very unstable GPS. Can’t avoid accidental touch because of curved display. Navigation bar( swipe gestures is not smooth). Sometimes have to do several times for swipe gestures. This is most frustrating issue the navigation bar from the bottom isn’t really responsive.

Several unfortunate problems sink this flagship
","

  Some great potential here, but for a $1,000 flagship phone it is a huge disappointment.  Others have summarized the good points so I am going to focus on the bad:1.  Despite false advertising, this phone is not dual SIM in the USA at least.  An update has been promised since April ""next update"" but every update it is the same, no dual SIM.2.  The curved edge is critical to control this phone - scrolling, back and forward, etc.  Very cool and it works great except that it is impossible to hold the phone securely without activating the edge controls.  This means you have to hold the phone in the palm of your hand without touching the sides - not an easy trick and it makes it easy to drop the phone.3.  Because of the edge control issue, cases are poorly made for this phone.  I have tried three including the official OnePlus case, and all have the same issue - the edge protector ridge interferes with the swiping needed for edge control functions.4.  We have a documented issue where messages SMS that messages that are actually sent show up as unsent.  This problem reappears from time to time and OnePlus tech supports only answer is to totally reset the phone from firmware boot ROM (losing all apps and app data).  I just ignore the "" message not sent"" errors now but that is unacceptable in a flagship.4. Battery life is really so so.  I got a lot more life on my Moto z4.  Maybe the issue is the impressive 120hz display which looks amazing.  But battery life is just too short... In heavy use it doesn't last more than 6-7 hours.  Again, not bad for a mid-range but a flagship must do better.

Incredible phone, pathetic customer service
","

  So, the phone is the Emperor of the Androids. The best Android phone ever made. The customer service of Oneplus on the other hand is downright pathetic. The agents are very nice and apologize profusely, but looks like the supervisor who is in charge of providing concessions never provides one, no matter how bad the company messes up. No top company operates like that.Another grievance is that being permanently banned on their reddit forum for simply promoting my Instagram while at the same time pasting a candid bad review of my experience with Oneplus. Fair I later read the rules which said that I should not self promote, which I didn't know before, but a permanent banning was cruel. Their admins never responded for my request to be added again. The support agents also promised that they would look into this and fix it, but never did. Pathetic.Also, I am not one of those big, hard to please complaining people haha, I have written plenty of great reviews for places or entities that deserved it throughout the years. Oneplus has just been whack though. Furthermore, I was promised that my concerns would be addressed and that the agent would try their best to get me a concession and admitted indeed I have been treated badly, apologized profusely, etc but never was I offered anything. One time an agent apologized to me and said Covid is to blame. No concession though, despite the company making over a billion dollars in profit.The final grievance is that support cases seem to get lost and mixed up with their support as well causing further time wasting of the customer

caveat emptor
","

  Have only been using the phone since Saturday, I only decided to write this review as a warning to Verizon users. It appears you can end up in a situation like myself where you are unable to receive text messages. I have been working w/ Verizon since Saturday to try and resolve to no avail. Outside of that, this should be the flagship phone for Android. Much better specs than we're seeing for the pixel 5 currently.Update: Having used the phone for the last month or so, it's still super buggy. I have issues w/ not being able to hear people who call me (intermittently), but I can hear them just fine if I call them, both on wifi(messenger) and over regular phone calls. Location services seems to not be right. I'll try and share my location, but it never updates, the ability to turn location always on is missing for a lot of apps. Issues sending MMS/Images over SMS. Some of this may be related to verizon, and I will know when my new sim card arrives, but I think a lot of it is due to custom OS that the OnePlus uses and apps not working properly with it. I would return if I could, but it appears that window has come and gone.

  Band 66 which is greatly needed shows on 5g whenever its connected. Phone specs show it it has band 66 in LTE And N66 for 5G. 5G on band N66 is less than half the speed of LTE in Cleveland Ohio with this phone.But can't connect to band 66 in LTE. Also voicemail gets broken with T-mobile with this phone. Battery life settled after 3 days and was great for 2 days then started dropping quickly. At day 5 it couldn't get through a full day. Also the next update converts the phone software to a clone of Samsung UI. No more Android stock look!

Good Specs, Bad Glass
","

  The overall phone itself is a good phone, especially for the price. That said, it has some glaring issues that shoot it in the foot, and I can't recommend it to basically anyone, especially not at $900.Pros:- Amazing battery life. Probably the best of any of the ""standard"" flagships.- Beautiful screen. The colors are great (outside of some small issues I'll mention below), it's crisp, and the 120hz is really nice.- Standard flagship specs, with a top end SoC, more RAM than a phone should ever really need, and a ton of storage.- Cheap for a flagship. Even though it's $900, it undercuts most of the competition. It's more expensive than older models, but it's got good specs on paper.- Good front camera position. The back one is a bit weird with how long it is, but the front punchout camera on the front is positioned very nicely. Unlike some of Samsung's models that have it right smack in the middle, OnePlus chose to put it to the side, and I personally think that's a great design decision.Cons:- The screen does have a bit of the tinting issues you might notice (frequently mentioned in reviews), but it's easy to adjust to and only really affects lower brightness settings.- Curved screen. I've never liked these a whole lot, and the One Plus is super sharply curved. Less a con and more a preference, but I leave it here because I disliked it.- The deal breaker: the glass. I'm inclined to believe I may have gotten a bad model, but I did a quick search and there's been at least a handful of other people who have had the issue. The phone uses Gorilla Glass 5 on the front, the same that most phones have for years. Every time GG ups a number, it's usually a little less scratch resistant but more shatter proof. However, this is the same as my previous phone, the Pixel 3XL. That phone is over two years old and has no scratches on it. I haven't been the nicest with it either; it's been slid along rough wood, dropped in dirt, stepped on at least once by accident, clawed by pets. And there is 0 scratching. I removed the screen protector on the OnePlus because I'm pretty careful; most of those were occasional accidents and I figured it would be fine, because I don't like the screen protector texture. Within a week of having the OnePlus 8, I started seeing scratching along the curve of the screen. Within 3 weeks, it had half a dozen small but pretty deep scratches and one very big one. I had the same case that I had on the Pixel (Spiggen's Tough Armor), and the glass on the Pixel had definitely seen it's share of use and ""scratching"" in terms of contact. It's the same glass, supposedly, and yet one was getting trashed in a fraction of the time. I can't say if it was a flawed model or what, but things that aren't harder than glass shoudlnt scratch it, and the Pixel had seen a *lot* more abuse than the OnePlus which I was babying. I hadn't dropped it at all, I only set it facedown maybe three times total, it was always alone in my pocket when it was there. I'm tempted to believe it was defective but I don't know. Either way, I've returned the phone but I thought I should share my experience.

Returned - Too Many Issues for an Expensive Phone
","

  Great battery life and quick to recharge. However, I had to return this particular phone. I was experiencing audio issues and also static sounds when I swiped my finger across the screen during a simple word game. In addition, there were frequent freeze-ups. I've had OnePlus before and it was a great phone. I'm going to assume that this particular phone (which I paid a lot of money for) was just a lemon, hopefully. There were a few other annoying things about the software, but those I could have lived with. But not the hardware issues.

Great hardware, Some complaints
","

  Tons of money, so I have high expectations. It's been three months of ownership.Negatives:Two months after ownership the company disabled one of the four cameras (the near-IR camera) with an OTA update. This camera was pretty cool and I had fun with it, got some cool shots. Extremely unimpressed that they can legally remove a hardware feature from my phone without telling me and not refunding me some of the $1000 price tag.The screen glass is very fragile. I'm bummed after all these years Gorilla Glass hasn't improved at all. Screen protectors on the curved screen are awful and I had remoced a crappy one for a week before my new one came in. Permanent almost chip like scratch, didn't drop it or anything.Dual SIM is still not supported after all this time, despite being promised. For a while I had bad cell service, but that was fixed in an update.Inscreen fingerprint is still unimpressive compared to old normal fingerprint sensors. Slower and less consistant, but usable.Positives:The 48MP camera is AMAZING. Just pure bliss to use. 4K60 videos are smooth, and stills are gorgeous. Great color and detail. Wish I could make 48MP the default, unimpressed with the 12MP mode.Screen is beautiful, bright, and smooth. Wish they were flat edges instead of curved. Some color inconsistancies on greys with low backlight.Battery life and charging options are great. Warp is fast, QuickCharge is very convienent, wireless charging is nice. I always use full resolution and 120Hz.Performance is excellent.Overall should last me a long time and overall pleased. Just wish all the stuff worked correctly.

One of the best flagships of 2020 with some caviats.

  I upgraded from a OnePlus 7 pro. I gotta say this phone is so lovely to use. It's hundreds less than s20+ and yet it is much better in my opinion. Cleaner ui close to stock Android with neat customizations. The display color accuracy is superb, I love how I can enable qhd and 120hz all while getting a good battery life with brightness at 75%. I use the phone daily throughout the day to web browse, watch YouTube, text, stream from Netflix Hulu etc, music with bluetooth, wifi mostly on all day and it's solid.Next the build is very excellent and that's how it should be for 1000 dollars.The cameras, the main sensor is super crisp, the wide angle is also quite sharp, and same goes for telephoto, the macro photography is actually super insane in this phone. It focuses so quickly across all cameras, the colors are super vivid and bright with nice contrast and I love how I can get insanely close to a subject and it still focuses without issues at all. Now I never really used much of the 30x zoom but it seems good and it can be useful to see things from far away. The selfie camera is good but I don't really care for the face smoothing. The overall camera quality is so good like for sure flagship level.The face unlock, fingerprint scanner are super quick and reliable. Works all the time. All the amazing features listed are so sick and work all the time! This phone is a beast. It's a phone that just works so I don't feel like I need to say much more.Now the only issue with this phone is the display. After just a day of use I started seeing image retention and burn in and it gradually got more noticeable as the weeks went on. At very low brightness there is a black bar/line that runs across from home punch camera but I don't really mind that because it's only visible from 0- like 30% ish brightness. It's the image retention that worries me for long term use. I personally have tried two units one from Amazon and OnePlus directly and both had the same issues. I didn't want to take the risk so I returned. I wouldn't recommend this phone with that display issue but if your unit is good then that's awesome.

  DO NOT BUYThe camera on my original pixel xl had better image stabilization then this one.Only good photos can be captured outside never inside.Battery life was good for the first month after that 5hrs screen on time  is max.I don't play mobile games I don't watch a lot of videos so it nky keep it at 1080p and 60hrzI work in IT so while in the field I remote into severs, use management software to run cmds in work stations, access documentation for specific al clients, roughly 100 emails I respond to per day. And while driving have podcasts playing.I talk roughly 1000min per month and send about 2k txts. Alot of mms for group messages.Pictures is very important in IT for documentation wiring, SNs, how things are configured physically before rework etc until you can document via text.So for a 1000$ phone that reviewers say oh its an amazing camera is BS.Since mms is a huge feature I need I will be reverting back to my original pixel xl because 90% of the images sent and or recieve never go through weather I use the default messages app or the Google one.

Does NOT work on Sprint

  Update:So I wanted to update my review to be a little more fair.  The phone is great!  I do love it but I had to switch carriers.  I was eventually going to be on T-Mobile, due to the merger, so I just jumped ship early.The phone being great still doesn't provide 5 stars due to the company being incorrect about who can support the phone.  If OnePlus wants to update their info about Sprint and reach out to me to admit they were incorrect at the time of my purchase, then I'd consider going up to 5 stars.  Until then, 3 stars due to incorrect information provided by OnePlus.Original:Before I purchased this phone I asked both a Sprint rep and a OnePlus rep if the phone would be compatible.  OnePlus stated it was an unlocked version so it would be and Sprint said if it was unlocked it would be.  Phone came in about an hour ago and here I am unable to activate it on the Sprint network.DO NOT BUY IF YOU'RE ON SPRINT!  Unless you want to switch providers.

Disappointed
","

  This is the first ""unlocked"" phone I've ever bought. I took the phone to Verizon to have them activate it etc. It was not near as smooth a process as I had hoped it would be. I've had the phone about a month now and my only real complaints in the beginning was the process of getting it activated and the built in alexa funtionality and the built in Alexa functionality was VERY important to me and the ONLY reason I bought an unlocked phone rather than getting one directly from my cell provider. However, here recently I've also been having issues where the on screen keyboard does not go away when its suppose to.Built in Alexa functionality:  It rarely triggers via the keyword the first time I say it. It usually takes 2-3 times. When it does trigger I get the message ""cannot connect to network"" a lot when at home and the phone is usually only 6 feet or so from my router and i have the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 AX6000 router and do not notice any network issues with any of my other devices.I don't know if the Alexa issues are phone related or Amazon related and I've never had an Alexa built in phone before to compare my experience too. For anyone that's had an Alexa built in phone I would love to know how your experience has been with it.At this point I'm strongly thinking about returning the phone as when i get new things my expectation is that everything works as it's suppose to work.I will say one thing i do really like about the phone is the display. It has the whitest white I've ever seen on any display (computer or phone).

  So far this phone has been great. Don't have an issues that others have written about on here. Upgrade from a 7 pro, so I don't see much of a difference in performance. But the battery life is a big improvement over the 7 pro. Warp charging is also a plus gets the battery from 0-100 in about an hour.Camera, ehh I just point and shoot. The photo looks good so i guess it good. Don't really have anything negative to say about the phone it self. I just wished the kept the pop-up selfie camera.Update: found that i couldn't get android auto to work with this phone and my vehicle or any of the vehicle that has an android auto head unit.

Moving from 3T to 8Pro
","

  Let me start off with saying those concerned aboutthe Alexa integration because of Amazon, it doesn't even come preinstalled. Those complaints are non-issues and the people who complained are to be ignored imo.This is a fantastic hunk of tech. I was slightly concerned I'd experience the screen toht issue, but I was lucky. The camera is a giant upgrade from my old 3T from 2016 and the feel is fantastic. Super smooth, super responsive, super clear.The only cons are that the included screen protectors were ruined by some tiny chunks of something that managed to fly into both (can't blame OnePlus for that because I have animals but it still sucked. I'd have liked a more robust applicator included, not just freehanding). The other is that gesture controls are a bit finicky at times with the edge of the screen, but the included case helps a lot there. Everything else is brilliant. Attached are some pictures of my animals using the phone. The dog was with portrait mode, the cat was nightscape.EDIT: SCREEN TINT DISCOVERYA few days ago I finally noticed the screen tint and where/why it happens. It ONLY happens in very low light. For example: laying in bed with lights off, and only in some apps. If you even bump the screen brightness a little manually, it goes away. If you have even a corner lamp on near you, it goes away. In my testing, Reddit gets a slight red tint and YouTube gets a slight green one. these are the only places I've really noticed it, and it's only in dark mode layouts as far as I've tested.All-in-all, it's a very minor issue that could be and will likely be fixed or adjusted for in future major updates to OxygenOS. Those complaining about it as a completely unforgivable negative should breathe a bit and relax. I'll dock a point from my original 5 stars for it, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not ruining my experience or life and I see no reason to return the phone. Your mileage may vary in that opinion, but I figured I should update this review

Received wrong device. *Updated*
","

  This is mostly a review on either Amazon or OnePlus fulfillment abilities at the moment.I put in an order for an Ultramarine Blue 8 Pro two weeks ago, only for my order to get delayed. And to put salt on the wound, I finally got the package today, only to reveal a standard 8 in Interstellar Glow. Not sure who screwed up here, but I'm just letting anyone interested know that getting theses phones in your hands is a process right now.Will update once I finally get the correct device.Update:Received the correct phone within the same week. Amazon guarantees that you will receive the correct item within 3-5 business days of receiving the returned item, which seems to happen even if it's out of stock. They must have some in reserve just in case. Say what you will about Amazon, but their customer service is top notch.If you're deciding between ordering off of OnePlus's website vs Amazon, definitely go Amazon for their service and accountability. Stock still seems to be an issue, so if you're willing to wait a month or so for that to steady, I'm sure you will encounter a much smoother experience than I did.The phone itself absolutely flies, and the ultramarine is straight up gorgeous. Quite an upgrade from my chugging Galaxy S8. However, no phone is worth the $400+ price premium gougers are charging when out of stock; the wait will be worth it.Overall, I'd rate everything a 3.5, but Amazon doesn't do half stars.

Better cell coverage and nice features.

  It is possible the 5g factor has improved my cell service. We have a remote property and my previous phone could not capture the internet and could not even make calls but the One Plus 8 Pro overcame this obstacle. The service out there is not perfect but I can make calls, download files, etc. Sometime there is lag. No problems in urban areas except that on occasion there is some lag in the scroll feature but this is not a huge annoyance to me, maybe for others, (after all, it is a thousand dollar device)! Color is great and I am still checking out the camera as I am only into week two with this phone. Lucky for me, I am not a fan of fingerprint readers but I gave it a try and encountered multiple failures, so I gave up on that. After giving up, I opted for a screen protector called ""glass helmet"" and I highly recommend this for a phone like the One Plus that has a curved edge. The protector is applied as a liquid and covers the phone perfectly, for a measly 20 bucks. I read tons of reviews and research before choosing the One Plus 8 Pro and I still think it is one of the very best of what is out there at this moment in marketing time.

Great phone, not a great upgrade

  I upgraded from the fantastic OnePlus 3. The OnePlus 8 Pro obviously is better in every aspect, from aesthetics to display/hardware/camera/sound performance. The 19:9 1440p/120hz screen is stunning (I got one that is perfectly calibrated) and probably the main reason I bought this device. I'm also a fan of the hole-punch front camera. No issues with curved screen. System is snappy and responsive.But was it worth $1k? Hardly. Same thing could be said for most of the flagships, just be aware that you might not need one. At least I know that it will last me for at least half a decade.

Front camera not good at all
","

  This phone is amazingly fast and responsive. The screen is great as well. My only issue is the front camera and the close camera on the back. The front washes out the picture. There was sun behind me and the whole screen went white because of that. Never had that issue before. If I use it and no face is in the shot it looks great, but once it detects your face it brightens up and beauty shots it way too much. And the close up camera in the back is just straight blurry. Will not focus at all. Other than that it's an amazing phone. Hope there's a software fix that can help the cameras.

Beautiful fast phone, limited volume control

  Upgrading from a Pixel 2 has been quite an incredible experience when it comes to display and speed. I'm very happy with my purchase on the hardware side of things.The main issue I have is the call and notification volume being on the same dial. please One Plus!!!

Best Flagship For The Money
","

  I have nothing negative to say about this phone so far. Even though it is more expensive than previous OP phones it is still cheaper than comparable flagships with similar specs.Upgrading from a OP 5T to the 8 Pro.  No display problems and it was a seemless transition between phones.  Within a few hours I had it transferred and setup.  The screen is gorgeous and responsive.  The inscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition are quick and accurate.  The camera is a huge step up even though the 5T camera was pretty good.  I love the dual speakers.  No I don't constantly muffle the sound when playing games in landscape mode.  COD mobile is performing better with higher graphics settings and the battery life is noticeably longer even with the phone settings maxed out.Also to note, don't listen to these negative reviewers about the Amazon Alexa.  These people haven't even purchased the device and their reviews should be deleted because they are ignorant.  The phone does not come with Amazon Alexa.  It merely supports it.  Just like it also supports Google Assistant(Natively) you have to install Amazon Alexa if you want it.

A supurb flagship - - - INFORMATION ON ALEXA BELOW
","

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones.  Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the  smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like.  However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships.  However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

Great looking (Interstellar Glow) with impressive battery life!
","

  I've been a Pixel person for many years now, but didn't have many options for an unlocked phone with near stockish Android and decent battery life.I will start by saying the phone doesn't have Alexa installed and it isn't required. Anyone giving it a poor review for that is misinformed.This phone seemed to be a better fit than a newer Pixel, but I was concerned with camera quality. The photos I've taken look really great and the camera app is very similar to the others I've used. I've taken several hundred pics since owning the phone and they have turned out almost as good (in some cases even better) than the ones taken with my Pixel 2 XL.I've installed all of my apps and been using it heavily and it gets significantly better battery life than my other phones. This was a big complaint and one of my primary reasons to upgrade. The screen on the 8 is really bright in Auto and adjusts well to surrounding light. Leaving the phone to adjust automatically has been fine most of the time and I rarely change it myself.The Warp Charging is absolutely amazing. Plugging it in for a short amount of time charges the battery up enough to use for hours. This wasn't really a huge selling point for me, but it did make me quite happy when I used it.The build quality and looks are impressive too. It just feels like a premium phone. The Interstellar Glow is an interesting color choice and it looks sogood in person. Any clear case will show off it's iridescent shine.Software has been a big win here. The simplicity of stock Android has always been appealing to me and getting away from that has been hard. You don't realize how much you were missing until you start using something like Oxygen OS on a OnePlus phone. You can change the icons on the entire phone with icon packs downloaded from Play Store. You can change the status bar, system icons, the color and shapes. So many things can be customized and it is so smooth.I was worried that I would spend the money to be let down, but this has been a great purchase. I'm happy with it and can't say enough good things about my new phone.

Incredible. Don't worry about Alexa, your wife won't see her.
","

  Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly satisfying this phone feels to use. Smooth as melted butter.I almost ended up getting another phone since the stock didn't seem like it was going to come back ever, and I was running my Moto X4 since I had had a OnePlus 6 die in the rain before that. It was totally worth the wait. I'm glad I didn't get another phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is simply a perfect phone for me.The software is unencumbered with very thoughtful additions and customizations. This what Android should be.At first I was skeptical about the size of the phone. I had read it is quite large and difficult for one hand use. I had looked at the measurements of the width versus other phones I had used, but you still never know until you hold a phone in your hand. This is good size for me. It is a very tall phone and the width is just fine for me. It looks good. I realize this is subjective to each individual, but it's not nearly as unusable with one hand as you might've thought. I love it with the sandstone case on.As far as Alexa, I had been skeptical at first as well and nearly waited to just get the one from OnePlus directly, but don't listen. Alexa has not come into my life. She won't bother you and disturb your peaceful life. I have not seen her once, so go ahead and take the plunge. Get the phone off Amazon, it's no different, plus buying with a prime card gives that nice 5% cash back.I won't get into any phone specifics since most people looking at the 8 Pro probably already know exactly what they're getting. It's as advertised. An absolute beast performance wise, and beauty to look at.Get yours already.

OnePlus does not get the credit it deserves
","

  This is my second Oneplus smartphone as I’m moving from the 6 to 8 and I’ve found a home with OnePlus. It may not have the name recognition in the USA that some of the other well-known brands do (Apple, Samsung, LG, Motorola, etc.) but now that more carriers are starting to adopt the brand in the states (Verizon & T-Mobile) it’s only a matter of time before it’s mentioned in the same breath as the Iphone or a galaxy. It has already topped many of the best phones of 2020 lists and for good reason. This phone is a beast, plain and simple. Whatever you throw at it, it can handle it plus more. Navigation in buttery smooth with a 90hz refresh rate screen. It’s got all the hardware you want under the hood with the latest Snapdragon processor on the market, 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage in the model I went with. It runs Android 10 with OxygenOS 10 UI which has always been good about giving the user great performance without shoving bloatware down your throat (it’s there but not in your face) They went away from the notch on the 6 and moved to a hole punch selfie camera on the 8 which really opens up the screen space.  The rear cameras are high-powered topping out at 48MP and takes superb pictures and videos. The 4300 mAh battery has already lasted me a complete day and some change including a twelve-hour shift at work as an IT professional when I’m constantly using my phone to perform tasks. The warp charger is insanely fast as I can go to empty to a full charge in about 45 minutes. What it lacks, I don’t miss. The headphone jack is no more from the 6 but most all phones have said goodbye to that relic from yesteryear. I don’t want to pay a premium for an IP68 rating (just get a SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle case and thank me later) nor do I care about wireless charging. If those things are important to you, pay the extra $100-200 and upgrade to the OnePlus 8 Pro. While the phone is 5g capable, unless you’re on T-Mobile, you will likely only see 4G LTE if you’re like me (AT&T) since the device is ahead of the carriers in terms of coverage and compatibility. The best Android experience around all at an affordable price point in the top tier of flagship devices. This is the smartphone you want. Don’t hesitate and purchase with supreme confidence.Pros• Smooth 90hz refresh rate• Snapdragon 865• 256GB of Storage and 12GB of memory• GSM Unlocked (AT&T, T-Mobile, etc)• Fast 30w WARP charging• 5G capable• Great picture quality• In screen fingerprint reader• Price is still exceptional compared to other flagship phones with similar specsCons• No IP68 dust/water resistant rating• Storage not expandable• No headphone jack• Lacks wireless charging• 5G currently only compatible on T-Mobile

New oem flagship
","

  It's my first day with the one plus 8 pro 256GB phone, coming from galaxy s9+ (2years ago). This phone is clearly faster, but the best part is the smooth scrolling. Screen looks good, and I tend to trust displaymate. The finger print reader is instant so far. I noticed the sound of this phone has better base than s9 plus, voice of YouTuber sounded better on speaker. As a Samsung lover, I've been wondering what features I may miss. So far just occasionally checking on Samsung what time I fell asleep. For a moment, I recall thinking, Atmos, I doubt one plus covered that base. But they did.The gs9 + is lighter, and a bit shorter, and I can tell it feels better when limited to one hand. The galaxy s20+, my other consideration, is even lighter than the s9 plus. I think this is the main disadvantage to me, but so far I'm excited to give a new oem a chance. I think one plus checked so many boxes it was a compelling choice. I'll try to update if I regret switching oems, which I usually do when I try anything else.

Awesome phone
","

  Have had this phone for a few days now. I grow more fond of it every day. I highly recommend setting up and doing a software update first thing. I am coming from a Pixel 2 XL. One of the big things for me was the camera. The OnePlus takes extremely good pictures and videos. Played around with the slow-mo option and it was pretty cool. The regular photos have slightly more exposure than my Pixel, but they are very crisp and clean. I imagine the camera and its features will only get better with future software updates. The phone itself is great. The features and flow of its Oxygen OS is phenomenal. My girlfriend got a Note 20 Ultra at the same time, and the layout and user-friendliness of the OnePlus seems better to me. On that note, the photos are almost identical on her phone and the OnePlus. I have spent some time playing around with the phone, watched videos, and read about features of the OnePlus, and there are a lot of ways to customize this phone. The fingerprint reader works well, however I did have to delete one of my thumb imprints a couple times for it to really work well. I've got both thumbs and a finger on file and they all work well now. There really are a lot of cool features with the phone that would be too much to list here. Youtube ""Tips and tricks for OnePlus 8 Pro"" and it'll pull up lots of stuff. The phone comes with a screen protector already installed, so that was a bonus. It smudges somewhat easily, but probably no more than any other screen proctector.I would buy this phone again in a heartbeat. It's really cool and has lot of customizations and really cool little features that make it awesome. I'll updated this review as things come up, good or bad.UPDATE, 9-15-20: Still loving it.

Beautiful, Funtional, Elegant....Exceeded my expectations...Warehouse deal a major +++
","

  There are many online reviews with very detailed statistics, and I suggest spec nerds to seek those out for more systematic and critical reviews.  I received my phone yesterday.  Setup was time consuming, but it is with any transfer.First....  The only reason I was getting a new phone is because my HTC One, which I've had forever, no longer has an operating system that passes security snuff for mobile banking--which I require.  I was able to get a discount due to a warehouse deal.  I'm happy with that.  Never heard of ONEPLUS, but appears that there are many afficionados.  Of course, I don't upgrade until absolutely necessary.  I have a powerful desktop and a laptop, so my phone is not my be all end all for connecting to internet--and I prefer a large connect screen for such stuff.  I went with this phone due to camera and operating speed  that was not available with Verizon's version.  I had to go to the store to get a sim card...It was not a company store, so I had to pay $15 but it was worth the money and time to get them to do it.  I'll let my husband have my old phone.Second:  I'm unclear why an item that is so expensive was left at my gate without a signature requirement.  Worse, when offering shipping feedback, there is no way to leave such a comment.  Amazon, if you want to improve customer service, then allow an easier way for your customers to give more constructive feedback.Third:  The fingerprint setup was not as clear as I thought...you have to roll your finger around, which was not self evident from instructions.  Video helped.Fourth:  I use ""MYPHONEXPLORER"" for interfacing with my phone.  It requires USB debugging to function.  You have to manually unlock developer tools in order to use this program (which allows effortless moving of your contacts if you don't save them in Google which I don't).  I found a video to help me with that.Fifth:  Errant characters found in some passwords (I had a tilde) might be hard to find.  Use the ?123 key and select the =\< (both at bottom left of the keyboard) to find other ""stuff"".  I did not see that earlier, but found it through a Reddit post.  I ended up changing my existing password to lose the tilde. (~) prior to finding the solution.Sixth:  Waterfall edge takes some getting used to....not a negative in the least, it just requires some getting used to.  Camera is far superior (and the reason why I did not get the Verizon version) than Verizon's offering.Of course, one delay for waiting until old phone is on death's door either functionally or physically, is having to develop muscle memory.  Also it took a very long time to download my old programs from one phone to the other...but I was pleased how seamlessly it worked.

Great phone, battery time, and the camera is finally legit flagship quality !
","

  Great phone, great camera and battery life. Despite the advertisement of Alexa being baked in , it is optional in my experience, as it did not come preinstalled, so for those concerned or interested, that's how my scenario played out.Light user so on the battery, it took about until 7pm for the battery to get to 50% , I know average screen time is listed as 8-9 hours though. This is on 120hz fhd as well.Camera is great. Love the super macro function and the night time camera. Coming from a OP3T, so any upgrade is a welcome one. My roommate had a S10+ and this phone seems to pummel the image quality.Charges from 50-100 in about 20~ minutes. Beautiful finish on the phone, keep in mind comes with two screen protectors, they didn't seem too sturdy so I'm planning on getting some tempered ones when they're available. The screen in itself is absolutely gorgeous.Downsides so far, screen edges are kind of difficult to navigate and the in display fingerprint reader feels like a step down from my 3T, definitely not as snappy, maybe I need to reconfigure my fingerprint, but there are times it can't read my print.I will update upon further use!

  If I could rate this a zero I would. Actually, I think the phone itself is nice.  I just cannot get it to work with Tracfone.  I have spent well over 6 hours on the phone with multiple tracfone reps over three days and they cannot get it to see the correct network to make or receive calls or texts, even though it has all the signal bars showing. I think it is a problem with the codes in it. Every time I call I have to start over again from square one.  Not sure what my options are other than throwing it out or switching to another carrier.

HORRIBLE Camera, Notifications don't work: Pros/Cons List
","

  UPDATE: Contacted Samsung and they could not/would not tell me if the camera blurs pictures automatically, or if my phone is broken.ATTACHED PICTURE: Left side is my old $100 LG Fiesta. Right side is this $100 Samsung (No Filters are on, settings at highest quality). Top 2 are with flash, bottom 2 are without. It's a pic of a stained paper towel, and counter, to show detail.Cons:Sometimes notifications just stop working.Sometimes Google Photos needs to be opened in order to upload pictures. All my other phones did it automatically.Camera is so bad, I thought there was plastic peel on it. sadly, it's just the phone. I'm going to have to carry my old phone to use as a camera.I've had an 8 and 5mp camera before, and it wasn't THIS bad. This phone blurs out the detail. (even with all filters off)Video will not stay focused while recording.Flash just whites out the subject.Can't turn the flash on and off during recording, you have to stop and start a new video.Battery drains quickly. 4-6% oversight, while it's doing nothing.Screenshots are clear UNTIL they upload to google, then everything gets blurry. (My old phone uploads didn't change quality that much) ex: both this and old phone have 5mp front, but this camera is WORSE, and then the uploads WORSE than the old LG.Screen is bright and the whites are bright blueish. My other phones had a matte quality to them. There is no setting to fix this. Even at night with the brightness set as low as it goes, hurts my eyes.........Pros:Good speakers, good audio recording in videoLots of settingsGood size phone.........Detailed:I went from the LG Fiesta to this.  LG has issues with being slow, not a lot of settings, and bad speakers and sound recording. I thought I was upgrading. I needed more space, 32GB, and this fit my price range.The camera on this is worse than a the past 2 phones I've had. And I had a phone with a 5mp and 1.3mp (which were better than this) I read reviews saying how good the camera was. So i'm shocked. It's not ""you get what you pay for"" bc the past 2 phones I've owned had better cameras, and they were the same price, for their time.I hate it.I'd return it if there was a 32GB tracfone alternative, with good reviews. But this one WAS the ""good one.""Never buying Samsung again.

not connecting to network, very disappointed

  this seems to be a common problem with this phone, I got it to work right once, now its on the fritz. Overall I like the phone operations, faster processor, and its (even though its bigger,) lighter than my old phone.Customer service... you have to work with a little bit, but I'm still in the process of diagnostics with TracFone to deduce if I need a new sim or a new cell, The chat rep was, I thought, helpful. The diagnostic rep that doesn't have the chat option... (considering they made me do all the steps I have already found on the internet... again... and didn't listen very well that I had in fact completed those steps) ....while on the phone, I unfortunately found less helpful. Usually I don't have much issue with TracFone.Would I recommend it? If you're lucky... maybe... maybe you will get the phone that isn't defective, considering the odds of a bad one are so high, probably not, no I don't think I would recommend it. I wouldn't want someone to go through the disappointment that I have had to go through and the struggle of trying every logical avenue to no avail after shelling out an over pieced piece of half hearted technology. Its a shame, cause if I had received a good phone, I wouldn't have need to review it as I happily would be using it instead. as I said earlier, other than being defective, I like this one.

Tech Support Needed? Beware!

  I purchased this phone 2 months ago and it was working well until after an update the bluetooth would not stay connected for more than 15 minutes after turning it on and even while in use bluetooth would be turned off. The only way to turn bluetooth back on was restart the phone. I contacted Samsung tech support several times and was even guided through a full factory reset. When that did not work to fix the problem I was instructed to take it to a shop where they would diagnose the issue. The shop declared it a motherboard issue and when contacted Samsung about it then and ONLY THEN did they tell me I had to go through Tracfone. I contacted Tracfone and they informed me that even though the issue is documented by multiple parties the warranty claim can't even begin to be filed until I try to fix the problem through THEM which I currently unable to because the phone is at the shop! It was only on the eighth call with Samsung that I was first told to contact Tracfone even though it is a motherboard issue (which is a Samsung product).

  The phone is responsive with fairy decent specifications for an inexpensive Samsung smart phone. The 5.83 inch screen is like the Samsung Note. Unfortunately, that is the end to the good news.The really bad hidden feature is the built in non-accessible battery. Once the battery dies, this phone is a throw away. Unfortunately, I bought the one from TracFone, which can be returned within 30 days but only at loss of half the purchase price. So once the battery dies, the phone is a throw away.

Unlike this phone, the Samsung Note 3 was not designed to be a $100 disposable phone. Once the battery dies in a year or two, I'll replace it with a refurbished Note 3.

Good phone with horrible design
","

  The phone itself works fine. It's got enough storage, the pictures are great, and it plays apps and videos no problem. It also looks good and is a great size that fits into your hand or pocket easily.However The design of this phone is awful. First off the speaker is on the bottom of the phone. Which I always find my hand covering and you can't even set the phone on your chest while laying down or the sound gets muffled. I just dont understand why they put the speaker on the bottom of the phone. Its not practical. Why not just put the speaker on top of the phone? Also another idiotic design of this phone is that the off button is on the exact same side as the volume buttons. Everytime I try to raise or lower the volume my hand hits the off button. I don't understand why they did that? Why not make the volume and off button on different sides? I also don't like the placement of the headphone jack. Who is designing these phones?Another gripe I have with this phone is the volume. It is not loud at all. I can barely hear videos sometimes. The volume needs to be way louder.Overall this phone has too much wrong with it for me to give it 5 stars. It seems like Samsung is going backwards in quality instead of forwards. I mean my old 2017 Samsung phone had a better design than this. This phone could have been awesome if it wasn't for the horrible design 😔.

Disappointed lack of connection and improper support from Tracfone.
","

  I have had difficulty with the phone. I cannot make any calls or send text messages. I see a message (not registered on the network), when I try to place a call. I contacted Tracfone for support and was on my land line phone for nearly two hours. Turn phone off, turn phone back on, do factory reset, and nothing worked. This is the second phone I purchased and am not able to use. After the conversation with Tracfone, they finally hung up and left me with no resolution.  I even tried speaking with a representative from Samsung. The representative was very curtieous, but was not able to resolve the issue because the phone is Locke to Tracfone. It seems that I will have to return the phone.

Alas, it did not work for me!

  I had to return this phone because it would not work where I live.  There was nothing wrong with the phone and I did like it.  It has a nice screen and a good feel.  I think if you live in an area with cell towers near by it would be a nice inexpensive phone to have, that being said I would not buy this from Amazon, and not because Amazon is a bad thing but because if the phone does not work for you, you will have to pay to ship it  back to Tracfone.  I have had a Tracfone for many years and I like the cell service and I must say this time the tech support I had to deal with for hours to try and get the phone to work were very nice people but in the end it did not work.  I had to buy a Tracfone LG Rebel 4 Lte because it could pick up 1 or 2 bars that are available where I live.  Those few bars allow me at least send a text.  I got the LG at W-mart so if it did not work I could take it back to the store.  I am going to miss the Samsung but if it doesn't work for me,  c'est la vie!

Bright and clear but battery drains

  After I bought it, it dropped another $20 (black Friday). The phone looks good, delivers bright and clear visuals. Picture by camera is OK but I am no fan of taking pics with phones.  The build appears to be solid; but time will tell since my previous (A Samsung but a different model that cost twice as this one just went dead one day about 2 years after very sparing use. This phone too is a backup only phone like the previous Samsung. The battery when the phone is not being used but just turned on drains about 16%/day; which is a lot when not being used.

  I really like the phone. It was easy to transfer my info from my old phone. The phone is easy to use and has many good features. The screen is clear and it takes good pictures. However I only gave it three stars overall because when it arrived it had already been opened, the SIM card installed, the battery had a partial charge, and when I tried to set my timezone it said it was set for a different country. Obviously the phone had already been used. I didn't have any choice because the charging pins were broke on my old phone and it was about to lose its charge so I had to keep the new phone so I could get everything transferred before I lost my charge on the old one.

A little frustrating at first, SIM card was missing
","

  SIM card was missing initially. As it was a ""locked"" phone, it was supposed to come with one. Tracfone supplied me with a replacement SIM card that arrived within 3 days and after that, setup was a breeze. It will take me a bit to get used to it as it's my first Samsung phone, but so far, I'm quite pleased with it.If you have issues setting it up, open the SIM card/MicroSD tray. You can't set it up without a SIM card. Two empty spaces indicate that the SIM card is missing. One empty space just means the MicroSD card slot is open, they don't come with one. If you are looking at it from the screen side, the SIM card goes on the left, gold contacts side down. MicroSD card's contacts go down as well.

  If you've ever sat down with a handheld calculator and estimated your phone bills - not over the course of a month, but over the course of ten years - that number approaches tens of thousands of dollars.  I bought this phone for its basic reliability and to save money.  I paid just north of $200.00.  The phone is guaranteed for one year.  I also bought extra protection for another $50.00.  Since the phone was unlocked, I immediately bought a tracfone sim card.  Tracfone sells crappy phones, but their talk, text and data plans are unbeatable.  I expect to get two years out of this phone.  If I do, I'll be happy.  The camera is phenomenal.  The battery life is superb.  The reception is pretty darn good.  Very few dropped calls.  The phone is responsive.  If things go south, I'll update.  For now?  I'm happy with this phone.

Not compatible with T-Mobile

  I completely loved this phone but unfortunately despite being advertised as T-Mobile compatible, I quickly figured out after 2 weeks of usage it wasn't. I had numerous times where people would call me and it would go straight to voicemail and the calls wouldn't even show up as missed or recent, or text messages not going through. I also noticed how at times it wouldn't even say 4G Lte but just an ""H"", I found it weird since I live Jersey City, right across NYC, so it couldn't be a connection issue, so I dug deeper and discovered this phone doesn't have all the required bands t mobile uses on their carrier locked phones, so though subtle at first you will be running into connection issues, if you have T mobile I would skip out on this one and get a phone that is fully compatible with the network.

  UPDATE (after 5 months): The phone randomly misses calls (totally ignores incoming calls like no connection) when it goes to sleep for too long.  I checked confirming where I was, signal, call in and out, etc. it all works ok; HOWEVER, if the phone was at sleep for a while, incoming calls will go directly to message.  Because problem is so random that I doubt I can return the phone.  Very disappointed.  My 4 years old Moto G4 PLUS passed down to my son is still going strong.  Had to get my wife another more trusted Samsung Note 8.  Won't buy Motorola again if they think their business slogan is ""you get what you pay for.""I owned a Moto G4plus before and mostly happy with it, so it's not surprised when I decided to buy this G8plus for my wife.  So far, no problem (cross fingers because I heard Moto G7 wasn't as good as G4 used to be).  anyway, will update my review if something comes up in the near future.

  I have had 4 Moto G series phone. I went from the G7 plus to the G8 plus. I use At&t so usually not an issue. I don't know if I got a dud or what but my first issue was my G7 plus was already running Android 10 and the G8 plus came with 9. So a couple hours of syncing it to my online backup and losing all my texts and I was finally up and running.The phone didn't want to copy from my old one since it was using the newer Android version.I played with it for a day and it worked great. Low light photos looked nice, however if you zoomed in and realized they were not very crisp at all.My real issue was that I realized I wasn't getting any calls. Then I tried to make outgoing calls and it kept saying ""no cellular service available"" even when I had full bars. I also noticed there were a lot of updates not on the phone but the updates were all in Spanish even though the phone language was set to English.In the end, it just didn't work. I am trying out a G8 power instead. Seems like the only real difference is it has a better batter and similar camera to my G7 plus which is fine with me.

  Moto 8 the most bang for the buck. As for all Motorola phones they have problems so-called glitches. Keep in mind when buying this phone there is no refund no money back. You buy this phone you own this phone. For better or for worse.The first Wi-Fi update is over Wi-Fi not your internet system on your phone all others updates after that will continue on Wi-Fi or your main internet. When I got this thing all set up the next day after it was jumpy on apps, responding funny. That night I do believe it was Google apps and platform whent crazy. The phone was flashing blinking talking crazy. It was rambling and inciting instructions. Locked up on a voice rambling rampage could not shut it down. it was definitely something out of The twilight zone I have never seen this ever happened. I had to force down the phone to shut down and go into the back programming and do a full factory reset. After reprogramming everything become okay. The phone runs good.

Action cam is useless

   The action cam is a really cool feature in principal, and is what sold me on this phone. The problem is the image stabilization on it is terrible. It creates jumpy and jerky video. You're better off filming with the main camera and applying image stabilization in post.Another issue is that it has no ability to focus on close objects. My 5 year old Samsung J7 takes much better up close photos.Overall picture quality is good, and I'm pretty impressed with it's performance in low light. Both the front and rear cameras take decent photos.Other things I like it that it didn't come loaded with bloatware. The UI is very fast and responsive. The Moto gesture actions are nice, too.The audio quality is probably the best feature of this phone. It sounds better than even most flagship phones, but this is a consolation prize as you'll still want to use headphones or a bluetooth speaker to really enjoy the sound.Overall I'm on the fence... I feel pretty ""meh"" about the phone. Buyers should also be aware it seems like this phone was made for the South American market. Some Motorola system messages are in Spanish despite English being set as the phone's language. It seems like all the support forums and groups are in Spanish as well.  I speak a little Spanish so it's not a problem for me, but it's something to be aware of.

Terrible Product

  I read so many reviews throughout the web and watched video comparisons with the final decision of the G8. I only had it for 2 weeks before I could no longer handle the frustration with the phone. There are plenty of reviews about the good so I'm just going to hit the bad, in my opinion. First, the battery life was great. I didnt have to charge it but every other day but suddenly, it just started draining quickly. Some days I would barely use the phone and it was half drained. I usually make sure apps are not running in the background and adjust the brightness on low. Second annoyance was the terrible bluetooth connection. Trying to connect phone to my car took longer than it should. I tried to setup my echo and the phone would not even register it. Third, the ability to lock/save messages. I have messages that I have to go back and look at often. With my galaxy I was able to star them and come back as needed but not with the g8. Last and most frustrating, everytime I would receive and make a call the screen would go black. I had no way to hang up or put on speaker. I would have to tell the person on the other line to hang up for me. I have been thankful that they all have picked or else they would be listening to a long VM. On top of call, my receivers said they could barely hear me or it would cut in and out.

  Great Phone, but even with only 18GB of the built-in 64GB of storage used, and more than 40GB free space, when I try to shoot a picture it says I need to free up space. Try to tell the phone to default to using the SD card to store photos, there's no way to do it. Move any and all photos to the SD card manually and still I get these stupid messages when trying to take a picture. By the time I deal with the issue whatever i was going to take a picture of, is gone. May be a small issue, but one reason I got this phone was to take pictures. RETURN!!! Next stop: LG or Sony

  I intended on sending this phone back but unfortunately, I did not have enough money to purchase a second phone to use while waiting to return this phone and get my money back for the Moto.  What I don't like about this phone is its lousy connection and missed calls.  It is NOT my service because I never had connectivity issues or dropout with my cheap LG phones, ever.  Secondly, this phone does not let you transfer applications to an SD card.  They have to be on the phones storage space.  Ridiculous.  And the battery life is not horrible but it is not great either.  I am very disappointed in this phone.

Decent Phone, Terribly Slow Android Patching, Not Good for Corporate Email
","

  I bought this phone to replace a G7 Plus that died a premature death in a swimming accident. The G7 had been slow to release Android security patches, but had finally received the December 1, 2019 patch in February 2020. I expected that a newer phone would receive patches at least as quickly as the older model. Well, in typically Motorola fashion, the G8 Plus that I purchased in March 2020 has an Android patch level of only November 2019. Despite checking repeatedly, the December patch is not available yet. My company's IT security requires a minimum patch level of December 1, 2019. So, my new phone cannot be used to access corporate email. If Motorola wants to play in the enterprise, they MUST improve their patch qualification and release process. If you need to use a phone to access corporate email, look elsewhere.Edit: After several months of ownership, Motorola appears to have improved the pace of their Android updates. They seem to lag Android by two months at this point. So, it seems to be better than it was. If two months meets your needs, then this phone is a great value.

Doesn't work on T-Mobile network.Decent phone. But G6 Play is a better deal.
","

  Edited: 16-Apr-2020This phone doesn't work on T-Mobile network. People who call me get my voicemail directly as of the phone is switched off  and I get the voicemail after an hour or more.Unfortunately, I thought it was a T-Mobile outage issue as one was going on in my area, but it's clear now that it's the phone problem.This phone does NOT support the bands that T-Mobile network operate on.I couldn't return the phone as I crossed the 1 month return time trying to trouble shoot the issue.Also the camera is not even close to what it should be with the specs it has. Very average picture quality.I will have to buy another phone now.–------------------------I had used Moto G6 play for over a years without any issue.  I decided to go for Moto G8 primarily for more space.I am using Moto G8 the exact same way and with same apps that I had on G6. Both have same battery size (4000 mAh) and they both die by end of the day. I do not play any games not do have any game apps on the phone. I use it primarily for office phone calls (2-3 hours per day), checking emails, messaging, news, directions using maps app (Waze), checking social media sites (FB, LinkedIn)  intermittently. The phone has better performance (faster response) compared to G6 but I wished that the battery life was a little better.

Overall good, some problems with the camera and no led light
","

  I'm using this phone after 3 years of Honor6x. I use my smartphones for texting, calling, internet, GPS driving, Teams for work, email for work, news, Reddit, alarm, camera, weather, WhatsApp, so basic usage. Whenever I get a phone, I make sure that I disable the battery usage for most of the apps in the background. Here is the review after a week.Pros:- extremely fast for regular usage. There is no lag or delay in the apps.- battery life about two days- fast charging because of the usb-c- security updates and software updates (this is the reason I switched from honor 6x, because they didn't have any updates anymore)- slim, light, buttons work very well.- good, simple, and efficient management softwareCons:- every time I take a picture, and want to look at it, I can't. The camera says no activity detected. I solved this by buying a camera app on Google play for $2.- there is no LED on the front screen, to indicate charging level, notifications, etc. Big problem for me.- no warranty from the manufacturer for US bought phones.Overall good, with some problems, it really depends on your personal preferences and style. For the price, it is good enough for me to keep, and it does the job that I want it to do.

First phone did not work
","

  I had to return the first phone sent to me because I was not able to make calls with it. I could talk over the phone on speaker phone but you could not hear the other person if speaker phone was turned off. The second phone so far has been pretty good. I love moto and the camera is really great. The only thing I've come across so far that isn't 5 stars is the fingerprint scanner. My phone will sometimes unlock itself without reading my fingerprint so it's not great for keeping it secure. Other than that seems to be working well!

My first new phone in a long time. More than pleased. (Edited) One issue.
","

  I haven't had this product for long but love it so far. It is definitely faster than my older phone and better in every other way as well.If you haven't had a new phone in a long time and are looking to finally get a budget friendly upgrade, this is a great option!Also my phone came in 1 day early, purchased from woot.EDIT:I am not sure if this was an issue with just a few phones or if it is with the newest update but mine must be plugged in and soft restarted to get any touch function in the phone. This being said if you DO turn your phone off or restart it constantly, you might want to look at something else until this has been notably fixed. If you DON'T turn your phone off or restart it often, then hey, it's a slight nuisance, but well worth paying only 200$ New rather than something with the same spec for 400$ New.POSSIBLE SPEAKER DISTORTION FIXI also noticed that my speaker phone and music at max became distorted after the second day. So much I was definitely going to return it, even put in the request..... better cancel that. Anywho! If this becomes an issue for you, first try taking as soft of a bristle toothbrush you can find and brush inside the speaker holes on the bottom (almost a soft jabbing motion). This fixed my speaker distortion by 100% and music is coming in clear at max again.

  1/2 year using. overall... good, functional. workhorse.  very occasional lag.  have both personal and work profile running.  dropped few times with no issues (using included basic case).  great speaker for phone conf or movies.  day+ battery life. getting security updates. highly reccomend.couple downsides:- no option to move apps to SD card- camera focus touchy... can be hit or miss- night photos could be better- no way to lock icons and prevent accidental move/delete- does occasionally miss a tapwish/hoping for android 10.. or skip to 11

So far, so good
","

  Overall, this phone has done everything it says it would do. The battery life is impressive. The browsing is responsive.  The screen quality is clear and resolute.I can't speak to it's performance in higher stressed scenarios, like playing multiplayer games or editing videos...but for most of the population, a device's ability in handling a moderate load of browsing and app use with deftness and agility is far, far, far more relevant. The moto 8 plus checks that box.Another hidden benefit is that it sends a stronger bluetooth signal than my prior phone (which was a lemon so i'll leave other comparisons in the air). This means calls over even a low priced headset are now totally clear on the other side (hallelujah). I connect faster and stay connected as well, regardless of the connection.As a heads up, this phone comes from south of the border so prepare yourself to wait 7 business days to receive it.

Good phone for most people

  Well for the money its a great phone and I am sad that I need to return it for such a small craftsmanship issue, screen, camera and all the features are good or better than most and just under flagship phone quality,  How ever I use the vibration feedback when typing and phone use to be able to use it and type faster. this phone how ever will vibrate and then have a residual vibration for about 2 seconds for each button press, so when you type it feels like an xbox controller going crazy instead of short responsive feedback, my other issue is there is still no android 10 update and 11 is already in testing and soon to roll out, moto/lenovo really just forgot about this phone it runs nearly stock android and they still cant update it in a reasonable amount of time when data theft is so common sad a good device has crap support not even ok support

  I have been using this phone for about a week now and am very pleased.In the Box:-The phone came brand new in the Motorola box with the chord, charger, pin to extract the SIM car/SD card holder, and clear phone case-Cons: directions were in Spanish (but images were pretty universal and most things were self-explanatory), free case is slippery and doesn't seem like it will provide much protectionPhone Itself:This is an excellent budget phone! So far...-Camera functions well (does not compare to the Pixel 4 or iPhone 11, but really great for the price)-Battery is very good (2 full days of use between charges)-Very quick processing for everyday use-TONS of built-in storage and room for expandable memory-Excellent speaker quality- Dolby settings is a great added bonus-Huge display with very little taken away for the camera in notched display-Finger print sensor on the back is great, with option to have PIN/swipe to unlock if phone is face-up on a table or something

Usable phone at an affordable price

  The Moto G8 Plus is not a ""top tier"" phone, but for only $200 it performs very well. Screen, cameras, and battery are all good for a lower priced mid-range phone. This is a GSM only model, it has a slot for either 2 SIM cards or can be used with one SIM and a micro SD. The Motorola interface is nice in that it's very close to vanilla Android, but Lenovo is slow to roll out new Android versions. I'm fine to wait, but it might not be for everyone. This is my second Moto phone after a G5 Plus, having used Google flagship phones (Nexus S, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 5) I do appreciate that the Moto experience isn't full of annoying UI changes or pre-installed garbage apps. The phone I received was an international model (Mexico) that included a US compliant charger and a USB-C cable.  This is also the first time I bought a phone that included a TPU case, so I didn't have to buy one aftermarket. Pretty happy with it so far.

  I had been afraid that this phone would not be compatible since it is an international model from somewhere Spanish speaking (as evidenced by the brief start up guide).  It's been working perfectly on Mint.  I had no trouble getting it set up.  I just moved the Sim card from the old phone to this one.  It's really an incredible deal.  You apparently can't get this phone straight out in the US.  I originally thought I would have to get the G7, but this is way way better! I'm not a phone geek, so this feels fancy enough for me!

A huge improvement from the previous G series phone I had.
","

  Battery life is impressive as I didn't even bother reading anything about the phone aside from internal storage and radio types; Wasn't expecting it to last as long as it does. Currently 3 days to recharge, and that's at 50% battery life. Don't know how long it'll last with heavy onscreen use, but I've had music streaming over BlueTooth from WiFi for several hours each day.Screen is generally responsive with games and applications, however, there are times touches don't register. I'm not certain what causes this, and this has only happened a few times. the finger print reader being moved to the back is much better. There is a notch in this one.  Camera takes decent photos but not great, however, this is to be expected given the price. It sadly doesn't run several legacy apps, though this is due to the OS and not the hardware itself (PlayStore doesn't list them as compatible for whatever reasons.). WiFi has been steady and reliable, though I would note that something's up with the BlueTooth. I sometimes have to close whatever I'm using to play music with because it starts cutting in and out. If you mostly use your phone for music like me, and do so to BlueTooth headsets and speakers, this can be very annoying. Seems to only happened just after turning BlueTooth back on, which might mean it's an issue with the myriad of applications I have installed. Over 10 media players, and I haven't set any of them up aside from PowerAmp and Amazon Music Player. Basically saying this might be because they're all trying to push and play through the BlueTooth. i.e. VLC Media Player, Backtrackit, and so on start trying to play music at once; I need to turn the auto play on connect off and haven't done that.One negative, though I don't just this phone as a phone, is that the volume doesn't have an easy means to turned up. At least with Google Hangouts / Google Voice calls. I could barely hear the other people's voices, and the volume up button didn't raise it enough to.  Coming on 40 years of age, so do have the normal hearing loss we get as we age, however, I should've still been able to hear them given I can on other phones. This is hopefully a settings issue. I don't know if it's an issue with actual carrier coverage as I don't currently have a means to testing that. It could also be a problem with Hangouts.

  I am IN LOVE with this phone already! I needed something with a better camera and, well, just a better phone altogether. Lol I run a small online business, so I need to capture my items accurately and clearly and this does it! Also, the battery life is kick a**! With heavy prolonged use I've been on my phone since 4 am (17 hours) and I'm at 43% right now. Compared to my old phone -which would be on the verge of dying by 7 or 8 am. The pictures are crisp and look high quality.The layout is different but it's really grown on me. The transfer and updates only took a few minutes and was super simple.I'm gonna sneak this in here -I haven't told my dude I got a new phone. This is day 2 of me having it and he hasn't noticed. New phone case and it's a different style than my last one. Any bets on how long it takes him to notice? 😂😂

Verified works in US At&t network

  I can verify that this phone does work in the us on at&t network. I just had to pop in my sim card and I was good to go. May have been easier for me because I was switching from a Moto g5, but if your sim card doesn't work they do have the correct one at at&t stores. I just switched to at&t a couple months ago and I'm using the same sim from the g5.Phone itself is solid. I've gone from the g4 to g5 and now the g8. I believe they are the most reliable budget phones out there.

Good phone -- Android 10 adds support for previously missing wifi calling.

  I purchased this phone to replace a Motorola G7+ with a smashed screen. The purchase price for the Motorola G8+ was $70 more than the screen replacement estimate for the G7+.  The phone was ordered on a Sunday and was supposed to be delivered on Wednesday. It actually arrived on Monday.  (within 24 hours!)In general I am happy with the phone. The camera is a step or two up from the G7. Speed is not noticeably faster then the G7 (which was fast enough for me) . A little more screen space. A little heavier and solid feeling.As delivered it came with a silicon cover. It did not include a charger or cable. It uses a standard USB-C connector.Popping the Mint SIM and micro SD card from the G7 to the G8+ was easy using the included pin.  Software transfer from a backup of the G7 was basically seamless.  Although some of the apps I used needed updates. The G7 had been updated to Android 10. The G8+ is Android 9. i am hoping for an upgrade to Android 10 soon for the G8+. (see below).The Motorola G8+ was not sold in the USA. The unit I received is a LATAM (Latin American) phone.  This means that the software updates came with Spanish language descriptions (the updates themselves are not language  dependent). This startled me, but worked fine.The only real annoyance to me was that when I bought the phone it didn't support wifi calling. No menu selection for it.  Lenovo support indicated that this model did not support it in the LATAM region.This was a serious problem for me because I depend on wifi calling at my second home as there is no cell coverage.  I resigned myself to either returning it  or waiting til I needed to replace it. (The G7+ had wifi calling support).So I am up at my second home, and I get a phone call on my G*+. What?  Is there a new tower?  Nope - no cell coverage.  Nevertheless, the phone is suddenly got wifi calling.  Overnight, Motorola pushed out the Android 10 system update and it added  Wifi calling, provisioned it magically.  Hoo-rah.

  My expectations for buying a pre-owned, late model iPhone is fairly low. I did not want to spend a lot of money on a smartphone. I find paying the price of a laptop for a new phone absolutely ridiculous. This is why I decided to buy a used iPhone 7. To my surprise, the phone I received was a well-rejuvenated unit. The battery is brand new (100% capacity) and the glass is polished with a nice protective screen. The back facing lens is slightly pitted but fairly unnoticeable and the were various dings and scratches in the back. I upgraded the phone to iOS 14 and it changed flawlessly - which lends to the impression that the reseller of this phone took the pains to make sure this phone operated close to new as possible. So kudos!I strongly recommend to carefully choose the reseller to buy their phones from. Some vendors don't do a good-enough job to ensure that the phones they sell is as close to new as possible. It is always a risk to buy a used phone and it is good to find one that you can return promptly and easily if you're dissatisfied.

   ***UPDATE 9/12/20 FOLLOWING MULTIPLE REPLACEMENT FAILURES***Back when the Samsung S7 Edge came out, I wanted it so badly - but couldn't afford it. A few years later and my current LG V20 is starting to get a little slow, and a new EDGE is available for $500 (presale price)? I'm all over this! Both of my parents bought it as well (they were both using the Samsung S7 - not the Edge version - which at this point are largely unusable), so I have three separate experiences with the exact same phone to compare. NOW ACTUALLY FIVE AS OF 9/12/20.Initial physical setup was a breeze. The SIM card slot (which also houses the SD card, if you have one) pops right out with an enclosed pin. The SIM and SD card connector faces the back of the phone. Slide it right in, and you're all done. The phone booted up just fine, and was at about 70% charge when I received it. It's a BEAUTIFUL phone, with vibrant colors and VERY smooth operation of the screen. I miss the app drawer, but I can live without it.Initially I was unable to receive text messages on Verizon, although every other function worked perfectly in every way. All three Motorola Edges had the same problem - all on Verizon. After several days of troubleshooting, my dad reached level three tech support at Motorola, who tied in with level two tech support at Verizon, and they figured out that Verizon needed to ""check, un-check, and re-check"" ""something"" in our account settings in order for text messages to be received by our phones. Once Verizon completed this cycle, text messages were fully functional instantaneously for all three of us. I was hoping that was the only issue... alas, I was not so lucky.A few days later, the screen started to develop a purple ""bruise"" on the left side, as described by MANY other reviewers. The next morning it was back to normal, but by the end of the day it was doing it again, and was worse than the prior evening. The next morning it was back to normal again, but 30 minutes later the bruise showed up again.I called Motorola tech support that afternoon. I had some difficulty understanding the woman I spoke with due to her accent, but I understood the majority of what she said. I was told that software technicians are aware of the problem and are working on a patch in the lab, and that when it is done it will be pushed to the phones automatically. I asked for a timeline, and was informed that they cannot say - which makes sense because you don't want to open a liability door for misleading customers, but at the same time I really needed an answer in some form. No answer was to be had, though. This was two days ago.By that evening, the lower left part of the screen was entirely blacked out, the bruise had spread to covering most of the left half of the screen, and had started on the right side as well. The next morning it was better, but only half-way so. Again the phone was unusable by that evening - which was last night.This morning the phone had improved by maybe only 25-30%. By 1:30 pm, not only were parts of the screen blacked out, but the bottom of the screen started flashing white and was non-responsive to touch (see attached pictures and video).I completed a master reset on my Motorola Edge, but the problem still persisted even after the phone was erased. At that point, I requested a replacement from Amazon. Thankfully my LG V20 still works just fine, so I have a fully functional backup until the new phone arrived.As my dad says, such a high failure rate is unexpectedly high for a new product launch. OTHER than this debilitating screen issue, I LOVE the phone - as do both of my parents.--------------------FIRST EDITThe first phone lasted one week before the failure as described above. The replacement lasted two weeks before the ""bruise"" showed up. By this time my dad's Edge had also started to fail. My mom's Edge, however, is still going strong. So the failure rate is now 75% (two for me, and dad's).Review is demoted from 3 stars to 1. If the screen doesn't work, the phone doesn't work. The phone is otherwise literally perfect. But if you can't use it, then it doesn't work. Period. I returned the replacement for a full refund. I'm heartbroken.--------------------SECOND EDITMy dad's replacement Edge lasted less than 2 weeks before that screen started to fail. Out of the FIVE Motorola Edge phones from me, my dad, and my mom, only my mom's has yet to develop screen failure. That is a whopping EIGHTY PERCENT failure rate. Both me and my dad have reverted back to our old phones, and will be shopping for a new NON-Motorola midrange phone soon.

Read Lenovos thread on Screen Defects! Happened with mine!
","

  For the first week or so the phone was great. Great stereo,battery life,great camera.. Suddenly developed an issue with the screen discoloring on the right edge side, especially while watching videos. It grew and grew the more the phone was used. Another week went by and it progressed to the point the screen won't even work and turned completely green. I use this for work so I had to immediately buy another phone. Couldn't wipe my info from it because the screen won't work, its flashing and turning solid green in seconds. Lenovo has a thread over 80 pages long about this phones dreaded screen problems. I wish I saw that before purchasing. Printing a label to return it.

Will not receive text or picture messages on Verizon!
","

  So I had some really high hopes for this phone; 6GB of RAM, 256GB of space, high resolution edge-to-edge screen, USB C, forward facing speaker, headphone jack, OLED screen, it ticked all the boxes for me.Out if the box it was quite a nice phone to hold and use, and it came with a bumper case too! All my apps were quickly installed, and I found little to dislike about the phone other than it could be a bit awkward if you were laying down say in bed and holding the phone upside down. Calls went through with good clarity.I didn't have any problems until the next day when I tried to log into my banking app and needed to enter a code from a text message. The app said that a message had been sent, nothing. Tried it again, still nothing. Texted my friend and he received a message. He texted me back and nothing. I went through all the phone settings multiple times, nothing seemed out of place. I finely broke down and called my provider (Verizon) to see if it was something on their end. Everything was as it should have been. I reinstalled my sim card into my old phone (Moto Z2 Play) and all the messages sent from the bank app, my friend, and Verizon as tests came through. Picture messages had the same problem. I figured it had to be an issue with my specific phone and requested a replacement.The replacement arrived today (8-12-20), and the first thing I did was try sending and receiving text messages. I was able to send, but not receive again. At this point, I'm pretty sure that this is a software issue, but I find it completely unacceptable to roll out a brand new model as a factory unlocked phone and not have it function properly on one of the most common networks in the U.S. There is at least one other review on Amazon outlining this same problem.This phone is on its way back to Amazon along with a case I ordered for it. If you have Verizon, look for a different phone that will function properly on their network.Very disappointed in Motorola!

Display Issues
","

  I too am having display issues with the Edge. I'm trying to work with Motorola to resolve them, but am wondering if I should just ask for a refund, given how many other people I'm noticing with the same issue. I want to like this phone, but I'm extremely troubled right now. Will update if I try a new one, but won't otherwise.Update 08/24/20: I'm sending the edge back, and getting a Galaxy A71 5g. I actually liked the feel and quality of the Edge better---- except for all the display issues. And given how many negative reviews I've read experiencing the same problem, and those who have even got a 2nd or 3rd phone with the same issue, I can't take my chances, my phone is too important for my work. Maybe next time, Motorola!

I so wanted this phone to work...
","

  Motorola website says this phone is only fully compatible with Sprint and Verizon. Using on AT&T it says it is not fully tested or compatible. But no further details. The problems I had were connection problems to the AT&T network. Everywhere it seemed I was on the fringe. Showed 5G but when I would talk to the phone it would not connect to the internet returned no connection error. When I would type something it would say could not connect to the internet. As my location changed a moment or two later it could connect to the internet. So either a AT&T band issue, 5G issue or poor antennas in the phone issue. I'm not sure but I'll have to return it. Wish the Motorola website would be more transparent and tell us why it's not fully compatible or tested on AT&T network.

  I think for $500, this phone does its job. However, I've started to have screen/display issues after having the phone for 2 months. Return window is closed so I'm going through Motorola now.

DREADED SCREEN BLOTCHES
","

  I read all the screen bleed/bruise horror stories but decided to roll the dice.  Bought this on Oct 29 and yesterday, Nov. 11, my screen started to bleed black/blue/purple from the right side.  It wasn't too bad at first but then got worse and worse.  Now it is about 2 inches tall and bleeds over in ""bumps"" from the right side about 3/8 inch into the screen.  Its starting to do it to a lesser degree on the left side.  There is definitely an issue with these screens.  The forums I read said that Motorola said it was ""software"" and not hadware related but those were dated July and supposedly Motorola has pushed out updates since then and nothing has been fixed.  I DO NOT recommend this phone.  This coming from someone who absolutely loved my last Motorola phone the GPower 7.  Although it will be a hassle of switching  back, I am going to do so and send this edge packing back to Amazon.

Major problems with screen
","

  On the positive side, the phone has nice features of nearly pristine android experience and moto features such as shake to turn on the flashlight.However, this phone has developed major problems with screen after about one month of use. The screen now has a green tint. Lately ""ghost"" images started to appear on the edge of the phone. It looks like many people on internet has reported this issue. If you value your time and money, do not buy this phone.

Not a good phone

  Had phone 2 months..never had a bad screen before..this phone screen splintered on the edge and cut my thumb..I did not drop it..it just appeared..the edge rounded screen is a pain to hold onto and takes up valuable room. Last phone was a Motorola g7 plus and the screen was a lot better and more functional.for this reason I must say do not buy this phone..$500 bucks down the rabbit hole.

UPDATE: Finally, the MOTO ""Flagship"" I have waited years for
","

  I have been waiting a long time for a ""flagship"" moto.  Really, I have missed Moto so much that I just wanted a OLED moto w/ a headphone jack.  But the Edge seemed to check a lot off my list.  Unfortunately I have been dismayed with what I received...  NO OPTION FOR WIFI CALLING.  :( ... a few perplexing things on Moto's part.-Buggy out of box -OS must have froze/shutdown several times trying to do normal setup-Case provided falls off phone-Case way to large to fit on phone. Basically useless. Falls off if you go to grab phone by case. More dangerous than not having one at all-Finger zoom-For some reason I cannot zoom on normal pictures, text, ect. Very odd. I have an LG, several Motos and a XIOAMI phones next to me where I am able to zoom in apps, web pages where the Edge I cannot. I don't understand this at all-NO OPTION ANYWHERE FOR WIFI CALLING- This may be the dealbreaker. I have LOTS of android phones including about five Motos (going back to G4) and they all at least have the option for Wifi calling (depends on carrier if it actually works) but the Edge does NOT even have it as an option. WHY MOTO, WHY???-I love gestures and they seem to work fine but what it the One Button Nav for?  It's still taking screen space but doesn't do anything? Very odd.If anyone is having these issues and it's human error - PLEASE LET ME KNOW - I really, truly hope my issues are human error, specifically the WIFI CALLING.  Please, anyone, let me know if you have any info regarding.  Thanks!UPDATE- After I sent this review, went on XDA and Motorola forums; I was told to root among other things.  I did notice the battery life from the time I took out of the box was not near as advertised.  After a few hours from a full charge I was on 20%.  I thought perhaps it was bc I was setting up, downloading apps, ect.  Day 2, I intentionally only started the phone, took SIM out and put in another for my driver that day (No wifi calling with ATT so cannot use at work).  Phone just say on my desk all day and with a full charge, by 3pm it was down to 40% - NOT BEING USED.Then yesterday I noticed the screen developing a purple ""bruise"" on the side.  It kept flickering and eventually grew so much it went into my main screen.So, this phone has been a complete mess since taken out of this box.Thankfully Amazon made it simple for me to get a replacement which I did.  I truly hope I received a lemon.If my replacement has the same type issues, then....I will update.

Update2: Screen defect showed up. returning
","

  Update 8/21/2020: Noticed some black dots on the bottom left of the screen which remain no matter what is on the screen.  Sometimes a light green or pink blob can be seen behind them. Was this phone model rushed to market before it was quite ready?  Returning.Update 8/18/2020:  I've now had the phone for 18 days and am becoming disappointed.  The size is longer than I like; top-heavy in a back pocket, very large for a purse,  and with wallet cases not available until Oct-Nov. I'm about to put my phone chips back in my Moto 4.  I did get a flexible case in order to attach a strap through its hole for the jack, but there's nothing to protect the screen so can't carry in a pocket.  The rear cameras are too close to the phone's edge, making it difficult to get a landscape-mode photo without a finger showing at the top where it's holding the camera.  I'm also having great difficulty getting the camera to actually take a photo when I press the button. Sometimes it does, sometimes it just puts a frame up on the screen or other such thing and doesn't take the photo.  It's also taking photos without the button being pressed (delayed photo? No timer is on that I know of) Came home yesterday with about as many photos of feet, thighs or table legs as intended shots.  At first I could zoom in or out, but it's in some setting now where I can't do that, and I can't figure out how to just get to a normal, auto format.  I'm looking for a user's manual for the camera but haven't been able to find one.  When on the internet, sometimes a page will jump; just wiggle like crazy; and the only way to stop it is to back out of the page.  What I thought were good instructions in the Moto app aren't showing up for the camera.  This phone will be going back if I can't find satisfactory instructions for the camera.It's a pretty phone if you like the size, and the features are plentiful but possibly too complicated for me.  This is not your grandmother's phone.  (I'm an early-adapter 69 year old.)Original review: I've been reading reviews of phone cameras for months, and had been waiting for the Iphone 12 to come out in hopes of getting an Iphone 11pro at an affordable price.  Then this phone was announced. The Motorola Edge has all the camera features hoped for, AND much more storage than an Iphone.  What I couldn't figure out from the listing was whether the 256 Gb was internal storage or what could be added with a mini SD card.  It turned out to be both. There's 256 internal, AND a mini SD card can also be added!I've had this a little short of two days.  The wrapped edge effect is very attractive, especially when using it to see how far charged it is, or for an enhancement for certain photos.  The wrapped edge can be turned off for specific apps so you don't have to read the news wrapped around the edges if you don't want. There's an action bar which is part of the screen on the right side of the phone that provides several navigation shortcuts.  It will take awhile to learn all the gestures to use this phone, but it has very easy instructions in the Moto app, so  I'll eventually learn to use the gestures and most of the phone's features.I especially like being able to open the camera with a couple of twists of the wrist, even before opening the phone with the onscreen fingerprint sensor.  I've just taken a few photos so far.  They're very clear.  The portrait photo background blurs the background a little.  There are lots of photo enhancement tools to try, and the cameras were the main reason for purchasing this phone.  Unedited photos taken in the evening are posted.  The tilt of the camera changed the lighting considerably. The second photo was taken a moment after the first to level the railing.  It also changed the lighting color.  The third photo doesn't have any kind of filter.  It showed fuchsia on the screen, so what you see is what you get.  Lots to learn about the cameras, which will be fun.The phone's solar black color is  iridescent, giving a beautiful, subtle color glow to the back of the phone.  So far there isn't a case for the Motorola Edge (just for the Edge +) but that surely will be available soon. (Looking for a wallet case with a clear edge and a strap for attaching to a belt loop while in a back pocket.)The sound quality is excellent.This phone is more exciting than any phone I've seen since my first smart phone; the Note 2; which was extremely difficult to learn to use.  It's a top-end phone at a mid-range price; especially if you can get it at the opening sale price.

UPDATED: Fantastic Unlocked Device - Hampered by a Lack of Software Commitment
","

  Update: *leaving original review below*So my device now has the green coloring described in other reviews.  I noticed it while using the phone with in a dark environment. I'm going to be returning the device because I'm concerned about it being a hardware issue that will get worse over time.  I also don't want to have to worry about in a replacement.Ugh.... It's a shame, I really liked this device. If you see it I would suggest contacting support (Motorola has a great reputation for support) and getting it repaired/replace or just return it.*ORIGINAL*So I'll touch on my likes first and then get into dislikes.  Just for background, I'm an individual who has used waaaayyy too many mobile phones, from premium to budget.  It's a horrible hobby trying out new devices, but hopefully I can put it good use for this review.  Also, I'm a bit of a tech geek, so some of my gripes or praises will obviously be different.- The screen is great.  It's a 90Hz Oled and just really looks good and feels good to navigate.  I also am a fan of the taller display.  It's easier to hold, and really helps with seeing more content (I love reading 3-books with it).- The software!  Motorola seriously has some of the best features on a phone.  It's very close to ""stock"" android, but they add just the right amount of features to enhance it.  (If you youtube any motorola phone reviews you can see these played out on the video, they are kind of difficult to describe in an Amazon review).- The battery is great; the Snapdragon 765 processor just isn't as power hungry as it's big brother the 865.  Motorola also put a large battery in the device, so it all pairs great.  You can easily just leave the 90Hz on all the time and get through the day fine.  No battery anxiety with this device.- Speaking of processor, it's great too, I'm not noticing a real difference between that and 865 devices I've tried out.  That being said, heavy gamers should go for the faster speed on a different device.  Everyone else, this is plenty of speed to last for a while.  It's a ""mid-range"" chip, but it's honestly in a new tier above that in my opinion.  Somewhere below the 865, but above the other mid-range chips.- Camera(s).  Look, these aren't going to be the best cameras out there, but they really are pretty good.  You have more control if you want to more granular with your photography decisions, but for those that just want to snap real quick, these cameras are all good.  Also, the wide-angle camera is good, and using it as macro-camera works great which I wasn't expecting.- General hardware is nice.  It has a plastic back, which I kind of actually prefer?  It doesn't feel cheap at all, and is well put together.- Speakers are great!  Stereo and get's loud.  In the same category, this phone has a flipping headphone jack which should be applauded.- Connectivity with T-mobile has been really good.  It also has 5G (no MM-wave, but whatever, even if it had the bands I wouldn't be able to use it anyway).- Fingerprint scanner is in the screen, and it works great for me.Negatives :(- The Edges on the display are just a little too extreme.  I haven't had any palm rejection issues or anything, it just kind of feels odd to hold sometimes.  To be fair, I'm getting used to it, but it is an adjustment.- Kind of in line with the edges, it's very hard to find legitimate accessories or protection for the device.  So, I'm going to always be a little paranoid about breaking the screen since I won't ever really be able to protect it.  Also, I realllly wish more cases were out for the phone (it comes with one which is nice, but still).  Maybe this will change with time.- Software.  ""But you said software was good"" - reader.  Yes, the software itself is great, it's just horribly unfortunate how non-comital Motorola/Lenovo is with their devices.  As far as I can tell, I'm only guaranteed Android 11 with this.  If they were to guarantee up to Android 13 (or let's be honest 14), then I would be screaming this phone's praises from the rooftops.  The hardware should be fine for years to come, it's just unforgivable to me that a company can't promise software support for longer.  This is kind of me wagging my finger at all the android OEMs, but Motorola really has an opportunity to differentiate themselves with a strong software commitment.- Vibration motor.  It's honestly the best I've felt on a Motorola phone, but it can still be better.  So kind of good job, but room for improvement.Overall:People, this phone is really great.  I think Motorola put a lot of thought into this  I love this device, and I think you should really consider buying it.For transparency, I bought this when it was $500 so the value for me is great.  If it's back up to $700, yeah, you might want to keep on eye on competitors (LG Velvet, new Pixel 4a (4a 5g) and 5, and the Samsung A71, or even the Iphone SE).  The main reason?  The software commitment from Motorola/Lenovo is so horribly frustrating.  They nailed it with the hardware (5G enabled and everything I listed) and current software screams that this device should be great for the next 4-5 years, but it's just hard for me to look past that software commitment of 1-year.  It's the main reason I'm putting a 4-star here.It's great seeing Motorola putting a device like this in the ""Mid-Range"" segment, and I would love to see them continue to push here.  Please just extend the support!

   I've been a fanboy of Motorola for decades. In the past, Moto has built solid, reliable products that have met or exceeded my expectations. I still use the Moto X (2014 / aka X2) series phones to this day. They are beautiful works of art, tough, and operate flawlessly. The X series would have arguably been considered their flagships back in the day. Then came along the Z series, but I won't bother opening that can of worms.I had high hopes for the new unlocked Edge, since the Edge+ was locked to Verizon. That said, there really wasn't any substantial differences between the two that would offer any viable reason to opt for the plus over the regular considering majority of the hardware is the same. On paper, I was concerned about the specs with the more conservative 765 Snapdragon CPU and 620 series GPU for what would be considered a ""flagship"" phone, but Motorola has done well in the past when it came to favoring more budget-friendly options -- case in point, the Moto X 2014's use of the 801 Snapdragon when other mfg's were using 625 series.The audio is among the best I've heard out of any smartphone speakers. The overall performance is pretty solid too. But that's where our story of the little Motorola that could descent into madness utter madness and disappointment.The harsh curvature of the screen edges wrapping around is atrocious to use. My meaty mitts grasp a hold of this oddly elongated brick of a phone and am constantly clicking on things that don't need to be clicked on. This was painfully obvious when trying to use the camera, but it doesn't end there. My fingertip was easily an inch away from the shutter and it snapped a shot prematurely before closing out back to the desktop. While in preview mode, holding the camera horizontally, if I panned up and down, black banding shadows would appear on screen. I see no purposeful use for the wrap-around screen other than sheer gimmick of ""look what I can do"". Also painfully obvious when held for photos is the incredibly thin and flexible rear plastic panel, reminding you, this is not the flagship you're searching for.The screen is bright, but only when it wants to be. I found myself fighting with the adaptive brightness controls constantly that I had to turn it off entirely or the screen would revert to being too dark to view. And let's talk about the elephant in the room -- the punch-through selfie camera. I'd rather just have a notch than see that massive black circle in my notifications area persistently making me think I have an active notification -- again, gimmicky.This was a short story about how Motorola lost their way -- these things happen when you're out of the game for 4 years.

Not Compatible with Verizon's 5G network

  If you are looking for a phone with a great camera, this is NOT your phone. Pictures came out dark and not very sharp. The finger print reader only worked without a screen protector, and with a pricy phone with curved edges, not an option. Also this phone is NOT compatible with Verizon's 5G network. If you like the style of this phone & a Verizon customer, get the Edge+. Solves all of these issues.

  I so wanted to like this phone, it has a great amount of storage, a good processor, a decent camera, and a beautiful looking aesthetic. But, to date, I have gone through three of these phones. All of them, after a month of regular use, start to display purple creep on the left side of the screen. This is ridiculous, a phone that cost this much, should not be continuously defective. It would be one thing if this was my first experience with the Motorola one edge. But this is the third phone to do it. As much as it pains me to say this, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE, at least until revisions the designer made, so that purple Creep no wonder happens.

  This phone is very beautiful.  Near stock Android is much cleaner to use.  Perform very well.  All the surfaces do not attract much finger prints.  Price was right at 499.

  We bought two to replace our aging Samsung phones we have had for almost 4 years. We decided to try these. One seems to be working fine. The other absolutely does not. It freezes up and turns black, and restarted alot on its own at first. Now it's hard to even make it restart. We are trying to get it exchanged. When we corresponded with Amazon, they just told my husband to restart the thing. They wanted him to factory reset, but then he would lose all the things he already has on it. We would really like a quick easy exchange. Send us a replacemt and we will send the defective one back. We think we will give a better eview if they can just help with this.

  A pity, I was looking forwards to this phone. Upon receiving it I noticed a few major issues.1) I receive a 403 Forbidden error whenever I try and make a call.2) The lenseof the bottommost camera is chipped. There was no shipping damage, so I can only assume that it is a manufacturing error.Will probably be returning or exchanging the phone...but the price went up by about $150 dollars. And that's way above my budget.

Updated (8/26): Quality issue with screens, Moto audio can be frustrating. Ok phone, but not for me.
","

  UPDATE 5 (8/26/2020): Ultimately, a return.It's sad to say but I am returning this phone. While it was replaced by motorola the screen is starting to exhibit a graininess or splotchy issue at low light. I just can't trust this phone nor it's screen to last past the year warranty. The edge is also not something that I can really put up with long term. Watching videos just doesn't feel right on a curved screen.Maybe this phone is for you, maybe I got two duds. Either way enjoy what you like but keep an eye out on your own device.UPDATE 4 (8/17/2020): Patience is strong with this phoneThe replacement phone that Motorola sent me does not have any screen issues 6 days later. People are reporting that the issues usually occur within the first 2 - 3 days so I think as long as it doesn't show any issues after a week you may be ok. It's still very hard to swallow a potential screen issue at the full retail price or any price for that matter. For those of us that purchased it at the discounted rate when it first launched, It is a good value still to me.However, if you need a phone that does phone things and are not a power user or don't really care about 5g (Which you shouldn't really unless it helps your coverage in rural area's), the Pixel 4a is my recommended pick. Or wait til the Pixel 4a 5g comes out which should have the same chipset.UPDATE 3 (8/11/2020): The dawn of a new phoneWell Motorola overnighted me a new a phone. You can see the difference in the screen quality. We'll see if the new phone experiences the same issue. Should start showing after a few days of use.UPDATE 2 (8/10/2020): The Motorola Replacement SagaI reached out to Motorola about the phone issue. There are A LOT of reports of the green tint issue on the screen on low light. It's possible the first batch is faulty so if you do get a replacement from Amazon directly it may not be better. Hopefully the replacement phone has a fixed screen, however if the 2nd replacement is faulty this will be returned to Amazon for a refund. People are reporting if you're ok in the first 3 - 4 days your screen is fine but this is just... not acceptable for the price.UPDATE 1 (8/5/2020): (Keeping original review below this)After using this phone for little more over four days, it is exhibiting issues similar to the Moto Edge + with the display. The display has a green tint to it at night under low light conditions. It's almost like a green haze and it's the upper half of the display (See attached photo). This makes sense as it uses the same display panel as the Moto Edge + which also has the green tint issue on some devices. If you encounter this issue it's possible it could be fixed via software but I would request a new device through Amazon or Motorola or just return it.(Original review):TL;DR - If you like to listen to music through bluetooth, there is a quirky fix that you may need to do if the music sounds flat or is missing bass.If you enjoy listening to music through Bluetooth, this is a bit of a mixed bag. There is an app called Moto Audio that always has an EQ and some weird tuning for any audio output through Bluetooth. It makes music sound incredibly tinny and flat and just plain awful. USB-C adapters or headphones plugged into the headphone jack disables this EQ however. There may be an option to disable the Moto Audio for bluetooth in the app itself, but the EQ may still remain. To fix this, plug in a pair of headphones either through the headphone jack or the USB-C port, and then unplug it and go back to your Bluetooth. The sound should be back to it's full and normal sound. Not sure if I got a weird bug but it the EQ continued to persist on my phone even with it being disabled initially.Otherwise it's a very nice phone. The screen is pretty vibrant and the 90hz refresh rate is nice. VoLTE and WiFi calling are working on T-Mobile through Straight Talk which is great. You'll be able to use this phone when T-Mobile phases out 3G calling starting on Jan 1st 2020. Also getting a 5G signal which is cool.No issues with the finger print sensor, works well with a screen protector (plastic) applied. The supplied case is nice as well since there are limited options available for this phone.The speakers are quite nice and loud too, music sounds pretty clean through them.With phones becoming more and more expensive, this is a pretty nice phone for the price. Sure there are cheaper phones but the 5G support, 765G Chipset, headphone jack, some water resistance and the design, I'd say this is a good mid-high range phone.

Has issues. After a months use.
","

  At the price I couldn't complain. It gave me 5g. I had a Google pixel and had issues with it and Google didn't care. I decided to go with the original cell phone company Motorola. The sound is amazing, storage is insane with an SD card. A headphone jack! Battery life is insane. The edges are getting used to but fine. Camera works like you want it to. Only thing is finger sensor can be finnicky but that's not bad. Hopefully this stands up for a couple years.After a months use. The screen got burnt in ink blots on the side and green screen. Not a well made screen.

Still waiting for the credit to be applied back to my debit card

  Nice phone but the screen is going bad. I got a replacement from Amazon today. Haven't changed over yet. Hopefully this one will hold up. Just started messing up about 3 days ago. I've had it about 3 weeks. It was fine until the last few days. Returned this phone for the same screen issue.  It's been 12 days since they received the phone from me and still waiting for it to be credited back to my debit card.  Haven't heard anything from Amazon. Should have been done by now

Early review is...  okay
","

  I've had the phone just a few days and here are my early thoughts....  they claim the battery is a 2 day battery life but I'm lucky to get a day out of it so that is disappointing.  I've tweaked a few settings to see if I can get the battery to last longer so we'll see how that goes.  If it doesn't get better I may return the phone as the battery should last longer than this.  My 3 year old Moto Z2 Play had a battery that lasted longer.  I've tried to set up the fingerprint reader several times and it still isn't working so I gave up on that.  On the positive the screen is beautiful and the phone is fast.  I'm not sure this is that big of an upgrade over my Moto Z2 Play however and for the money it should be.  I'm not ready to give up yet but so far I am somewhat disappointed.

Bought two - one is good, one is terrible
","

  (Aug 14 update)Replacement received on four days ago. I've been using the phone every day and it's working fine so far. I had a scare when I notice a portion of the screen ""bruised"" purple, but it was only the wallpaper. I'm starting to use the features of the phone and like it more every day. My first impressions are all positive with a few hiccups here and there but nothing I can't live with. I have not returned the original device as I've been waiting for the weekend. It's been powered off for days, so I turned it on two days ago. It was like it was brand new again and the screen issues were gone... all of them. However, within the hour, one by one, all previous screen issues came to say hello. Again, this is in the original faulty phone. The new phone is working fine so far. Wife's phone ""is still nice and cool."" Will do another update once I test the replacement phone over the weekend.(Aug 8, 2020 - Original post)TL:DR - Bought a phone for me and one for my wife. She loves hers and is working fine. Mine went from bad to worse to completely unusable by day 5. Pictures included here show the progression of the screen problems. I will update this review when I receive and use my replacement phone.-------Since I have not used my phone much and my wife is pretty much happy with hers because ""it looks cool and it works,"" I will focus my review on my experience so far. I have not been able to use the phone for too long due to terrible screen issues.,  so here is a day by day summary. Note that we only use the included plastic cover and no screen protector, so nothing has been used other than what came in the box.Day 1 - Phone looked awesome straight out of the box. Coming from the original Google Pixel (4 years old), this was quite an improvement. We used to have Motorola devices for the previous two before the Pixel. Setup of the device was a walk in the park, and all data was restored properly from the old phones. The default start-up screen and the default live wallpaper (waves) showed an amazing display! Both phones were able to send SMS messages, but would not receive them. Looks like it was a problem on Verizon's side and a quick chat with their support desk fixed the issue. Wife's phone had no issues after that. Mine had trouble updating Google Chrome (it would just not start it) and would not back up the phone even after several hours. I could not fix either issue on day 1.Day 2 - Not even 24 hours of usage, and the screen started to show a green tint under low light. This was obvious when compared to my wife's. After googling the issue, I found out that this was a common problem with the Edge+ and since they use the same screen hardware, well, same issue. It did not bug me too much though. The same day but later, I noticed a faint ""burned-in"" square at the bottom of the screen when any color other than white was on that area. I rebooted the phone and it was still visible during the start-up screen. After chatting with Lenovo support and posting in the forums, the square was suspected to be a detached fingerprint sensor since it appeared in the exact same spot where the fingerprint icon shows to unlock the phone. The suggestion was to request a replacement though Amazon since I had only had the phone for two days. By night, the ""green tinting"" of the screen was worse and some menus were very faint. I did a factory reset just to see what happened. Obviously, nothing was magically fixed, but I was now able to update Chrome and my device was backing up.Day 3 - Alas, I woke up and when I looked at my phone, I saw a small ""purple bruise"" on the left edge of the screen. I had never dropped the phone, so I wondered what that was. A Google search confirmed that this was another known issue with the Edge+ screen and now the Edge. Just my luck. Now I had a ""square"" and a ""bruise"" Interesting enough, the ""bruise"" was expanding through out the day. What was a small spot on the edge had now migrated to the main screen area.Day 4 - I woke up and looked at my phone. It all looked the same... square and bruise. As I used the phone, the ""bruise"" would expand and contract from time to time. As the day went by, the ""bruise"" ended up taking a third of the screen (left side). At one point, the ""bruise"" shrunk, and the screen started showing ""ghosting"" images (see picture). I needed to run errands, so I jumped into my car and fired up Google Maps. During my drive, the screen started to flash rapidly, so I turned the phone off. When I got to a store, I started up the phone, and now half of the screen was bright white. When I got home, I tried to use the phone, and the entire screen was now bright white and flashing and it didn't sense my touch. If I left the phone resting for a while, I was able to unlock it and use it for a minute, then the bright white screen and the flashing continued and I was unable to use the phone.That's where I am today. Wife is happy with her phone, so at least I have that going for me, but my personal experience has been completely frustrating. I'll see how things go once I receive the replacement next week... if I'm lucky since it seems to be out of stock at the moment.

Great phone but doesn't fully support AT&T
","

  Battery life is amazing, the in-screen fingerprint reader works perfect, 90hz screen is great for this price.I really wish it worked better on AT&T. If you are thinking about purchasing, I would check to make sure it fully supports your carrier based on Motorola's website.

Great phone, hope they can fix the issues.

  This phone is amazing. The screen was super clear, the battery life is great and the processor is right on par with other phones in this mid range tier. Only problem is that after 2 weeks of use, the screen started turning green on the edges and the sharpness and brightness began to diminish. Much to my dismay, I had to request a replacement for this unit. Hopefully the replacement will work as it should.

Eh, it's ok but over priced
","

  Nice phone, unfortunately all the accessories I've purchased to go along with it are super cheap. No decent brand makes a phone case and if you can find the right screen protector(edge+ is more common and different size), you can't have both on at the same time effectively meaning you have to protect the screen or the body of the phone but not both.Phone was glitchy at first but is normal now. First phone I've had that cost more than $200. I've had way less trouble with almost any phone I've ever had. Probably will stick to low end Samsung/LG phones in the future.Bought this for the 64mb camera and that's the best feature, it takes great photos. Hopefully without a proper screen protector I can keep the phone in one piece for a couple years, but we'll see...

The Moto Edge problems on Verizon
","

  Update: Had to return do to not being able to get Verizon LTE + or 5G. Also I couldnt receive Text messages.This phone is one of the best you can get at the price for a 5G phone. It is nearly identical to the Edge+ with a few differences. Its a big phone but slim enough to fit well in your hand. The edge display has minimal uses but it is good for some mobile games. I have some concern that if you drop it the edge display won't with stand a drop on a hard surface. Motorola will only update it to Android 11. Overall this is a solid phone for the price and specs.PROS* decent display* good battery life* 3.5 mm headphone jack* good call qualityCONS* in-display fingerprint sensor isn't the best* no wireless charging* camera is just okay* curved display limited

Rolling the dice.  Amazing as of 12/30 Updating periodically
","

  Update: still no issues. I almost forgot that I'm expecting any.Update 2: phone's beautiful. I'm never using anything else unless there's a second version of this device.I've been reading up on this phone, I know about the display issues, the blotches, the strobbing. And I bit the bullet.After a few days of active use, it's turning out really well.I was proactive in avoiding those problems people have stated.Ive kinda got a good idea on what the problems could actually be (besides the screens being straight up defective)I saw where people were usually and typically holding their devices, and the screen blotches tend to match up with where their fingers would grip the phone.So, I've bought a pop socket so I'm not directly squeezing or gripping the sides of the screen, and when I do grip the phone, I'm doing it as lightly as possible.Overheating was something I also read about, so I keep my screen brightness around half. If I feel the back of the phone starting to warm up, I let it sit for a few minutes to cool off. I haven't had a real issue with the phone running hot, but I just want to be extra careful.I haven't noticed any sort of green tint yet (and hopefully never) and I'm hopeful that my screen will just be fine in the future.But again, I'll be actively updating this with my experience with the device.But it is an amazing phone, a vibrant screen, stereo speakers, the build feels phenomenal and nice in the hands. The edge touch quick actions feela nice to use and are convenient to have up to 6 apps at the side of the screen ready to open.The phone is fast with it's decent processor, swiping between apps is responsive and snappy, and smooth while doing so.I'm committed to this phone after just a few days of use, and frankly I hope I never have to replace this device due to defects.

This is a GREAT phone, but suffers from certain issues...
","

  First of all, this is a fantastic phone for the price - not the $700 MSRP, but with the $200 discount. I truly believe that $500 is what this phone should cost, and I never would've bought it at $700. With all of that out of the way, let me explain why I love this phone.This phone, at the discounted $500 price tag, is essentially priced as an upper mid-range phone but reaching for flagship features. I love that it has all the things I need - NFC, 5G, headphone jack, fantastic speakers, great battery life, good cameras. The waterfall screen is also an eye catcher as well. There are a lot of other ppl saying that they're suffering from a faulty screen causing a green tinge - I have yet to experience this problem. On the contrary, I love the color and the contrast of the OLED display. The only annoyance I've had with this phone is that it is quite big, and sometimes I cant reach everything with one hand.Now on to the bad. I dont have much to complain about hardware-wise. All of it the complaints stem from Motorola's actions/decisions. As far as I know, Moto is only guaranteeing 1 major android update. Since this runs android 10, I'm only guaranteed android 11. Not a smart move if they're trying to sell this phone for $700. However, since Samsung is pledging 3 years of support, I think Moto may be pressured to follow suit - at least I'm hoping. Another dissatisfaction I have is also related to software. I'm with T-mobile, and they have stand-alone 5g - which means it doesn't piggy back off of LTE. I want to use SA 5g, and all the hardware in this phone are capable of it; it's just unlocking the potential from the software perspective. Again, from all the research I've done so far, it doesn't seem like Moto will implement SA 5g on any of their updates. I hope they prove me wrong.Ultimately, this is a great phone, but corporate politics may be digging their own grave.

Love it
","

  I have been using Motorola phones for quite a Time with an LG, an iPhone mixed in there years ago that I did not care for. For whatever reason, I just enjoy these phones. I bought the edge because of the specs, not because of the design. The shape is similar to the Moto G6 I had years ago, and this is a replacement for my Moto Z3 play.  I have the edge option actually turned off, and I also do not use the three button option. So basically, with the case I have on it, the edges really do not come into play except for a noticeable curve on the sides with some screens, which you can also turn off.  The battery life is great, the 5G option is pretty much N/A for me because I live in a rural error area but I am looking forward to seeing how it does when I travel to a big ole city.  I have a screen protector that wraps around the edges that I do not have issues with, and I have never had an issue with the fingerprint sensor. I know the cameras are not the highest rated on phones, but I have fiddled with it and made some of the best pictures I've ever taken with any phone/camera.  Perhaps I am one of the lucky ones, but I have had no issues with the discolored screens that other people keep mentioning. or maybe it is because I bought a certified refurbished and they fixed the issue? I really do not know, but over a month into ownership I have absolutely zero complaints.  Oh, the reason I only gave it four stars is because it burns me up when I go to leave a review and see a product listed for significantly less than it was when I bought it just a month ago.

Awesome battery life!
","

  I had a google pixel XL and as is the case with most phones, mysteriously after 2 years, the battery just wouldn't keep a charge. I dealt with it for almost a year,  but when I saw the motorola edge on sale at Amazon and after looking into the reviews, I decided to buy it. Here are the quick and dirty take aways.1. Screen is kinda cool, but the ""edge"" features almost get in the way from just holding the phone (I disabled for most apps)2. The battery life is amazing. I'm not on my phone all the time, but it lasted easily for a week (7 days) without me having to charge.3. I've had three software updates (pushes) since I received the phone. Unfortunately  the updates didn't fix an issue that is a little annoying (see number 4).4. If I try to look something up when ""not"" near a WiFi, it gives me a no WiFi available and doesn't automatically switch over to LTE or 5G. I have to restart the phone to get it to work.Overall I am happy with the phone, specifically the long battery life. I'm hoping that updates will fix some of the quirks.

Meh, it's a phone.
","

  I've read all the reviews but still bought the phone. Here are my thoughts: The battery does not last as long as my old Sony Xperia even though it's a much bigger battery. Maybe I'm on it more. I noticed apps like Facebook ran the battery quick so I removed it. It still seems weaker.I haven't noticed any screen issues being reported thus far. I'm not a fan of the curved screen because I keep touching an edge without meaning to. Today was day 30. The point of no return, literally. And today my phone just froze for no reason. I got it to restart but soon after it froze again. This time it rebooted by itself. (Is that motorola's version of AI?) it seems to be working now.Motorola suggested uninstalling any app that I installed lately. It's a new phone, everything was installed lately!When it came back on I noticed an error a widget couldn't load. So maybe it doesn't like that app.Other things to note: There aren't many cases for the phone, but I'm used to that coming from an Xperia. That being said, I'm used to buggy phones. Sony was not the best when it came to seamless work. I never got that thing to sync with my car stereo besides calling.Camera is there. I don't buy a phone for the camera. I buy a camera for a camera. I've taken 3 pictures and 2 were by accident.I'll keep updating as things I learn.

Some issues, but good phone.

  Cell radio is garbage, signal reception is always low compared to previous moto devices I've had. 1-15 times a day I need to toggle airplane mode to reconnect cellular data. wifi radio is flawless. Speakers are amazing and crazy loud, but have noticable battery drain at high volume. Screens is gorgeous but corners have issues in some games and apps. Almost always snappy and responsive, must be rebooted at least every week to avoid bugs. Overall, superior experience to oneplus 7 I had last year, and absolutely a tier above moto Z - alas I will be missing my moto mods.

  I haven't had it long but have no complaints with the phone itself, so far I like it. I buy my phones based on camera and battery life as well as price. However, this phone does not have WiFi capabilities at least not with Verizon Wireless. I could not get cell signal with my booster as either. The rep suggested a new booster and it took care of that problem. I have an unlimited plan so will keep the phone but seems to me WiFi calling should be standard on all phones!!!!

Good phone for when you can find it on sale
","

  I think this is overall a very solid phone. Its one of the best performing Android phones I have owned and probably closest to the Lumia 1520 which I have been trying to find a comparable replacement for since the battery died in mine and Microsoft killed their mobile OS. Would honestly be a 3.0 star rating overall at the regular price for me, dinging it on the point that most phones suffer from these days in that they are overpriced for their performance levels and features these days. But if you can get it on sale for around 400 that is a price I am in much more comfortable recommending than at the 700 dollar original price.

Outstanding phone!
","

  I bought two of these phones, one for me and one for my wife. Both have been performing excellently since day 1. Easy to use, fantastic screen views, and WOW with the 5G functionality!To be clear, we've had NONE of the issues that other reviewers have mentioned (""bruised"" screen display, finicky fingerprint reader, lack of wifi calling, text message issues, etc.).Our phones are on the T-Mobile network. I made sure to call our carrier to have them provision our SIM's for wifi calling right away. We've had wifi calling since the moment we turned our phones on for the first time.I can't speak to the issues the Verizon customers have had with text messaging. All I can say is that our text messages work flawlessly on T-Mobile (note we use RCS chat).As far as 5G service, since we're on T-Mobile I've gone to the their website to see the 5G coverage in our area. Turns out we live right at one of the edges of a 5G zone. Not to worry, though. We get a solid 5G signal here. And I do mean solid (5 out of 5 bars).One interesting thing I've discovered about the phone is that when we're on wifi that the phone switches over to 4G/LTE. I'm not sure why it does that, but no complaints, since we get blazingly fast internet service either on wifi or on 5G.Other features are excellent. The 90hz refresh is sweet (super smooth videos and scrolling). No problems setting any Bluetooth devices. I also used the 3.5mm jack for audio and can say it worked well, though the sound quality I wanted was not what I got, likely due to the old Blackberry earpods I used for listening (I'd love to try it again with a better set, but probably won't, since I've got several Bluetooth headsets that work well). And the fingerprint feature has been right on for both of us on our phones - works every time.As a side comment, the ""edge"" viewing feature takes a bit getting used to, but it is cool. The phone has a an option to turn it off but we haven't tried that yet as we haven't found a good reason to do so.Our phones are currently protected with screen protectors and TPU cases. What we really want are more robust cases (like the Unicorn Bettles) that have built in screen protectors and solid case bodies. We're still waiting, and hoping that Unicorn or another supplier like them release cases like this in the near future.Bottom line - we wholeheartedly recommend this phone. Absolutely no issues and solid performance.

  Simply stunning phone. I'm absolutely blown away bye the screen the speed and the overall quality of the device. Watching videos or playing games on the Motorola edge is like playing on a handheld game console from the future.

Also the battery life is amazing goes and goes and goes, Motorola did such a good job.

Best replacement for a Samsung Note 10+
","

  I got my Edge when it was on sale for $400 a week ago. My $1100 Samsung Note 10+ failed on me after just 1 year so I needed a replacement. I refuse to buy anymore Samsung devices because they aren't reliable. They are extremely expensive and short-lived. So it became time to switch brands and I chose Motorola.So far I'm loving my Edge. The battery life is excellent. The overall speed of the system is easily as fast as the Note 10. The fingerprint sensor is way faster than ANY Samsung phone. And even face unlock is faster. The only downside so far are system updates. Currently my Edge has October security patch, and that was receive just a couple days ago (Nov. 15, 2020). But Motorola has promised to update it to Android 11 at some point this year.The 5G networking on T-Mobile is producing a much better data signal than my 4G Note 10+. In fact, at home in Oklahoma City...around some high quality and numerous cell towers (according to T-Mobile customer service) I couldn't any signal at all with my Note 10+. But my Edge is providing on average around 50Mb/s. Sometimes it will measure over 100Mb/s, sometimes below 30Mb/s.I've read about the Edge having ""screen issues"" and I'm keeping an eye out for them, but so far the display is gorgeous. Everything about this phone is satisfying...with the exception of finding a high-quality, name brand case for it. There are none other than overly-expensive Otterbox. No Spigen, no Caseology etc.I did find a case from Dzxouui that is working well, but I had to make a gasket (from some shelving material made of 1mm or 2mm thick rubber and held it in place on the phone with some Glue Stick) for the camera hole on the back because it has a significant gap between the hole and the back of the phone that allows dust and particulates to enter easily.Words of advice: Avoid Samsung phones.

Serious display defect.
","

  I bought 2 of this phone and had one replaced twice due to display problems making the phone unusuable.  Overheating, green screen, smudges coming in from the side of the screen and expanding to grey bands, purple spots, ghosting on screen, blinking horizontal lines and gets progressively worse until the phone has to have the screen or the phone turned off.These problems started within the first week of getting the phone.The second phone worked fine for about a month, but then started having the same display issues.  It was replaced once and same issues started within a few days.I was able to return one of the phones for a refund, but am stuck with the other one because it is past the return window.Motorola will replace the phone I'm stuck with but I have little confidence about it being free of the same display issues.It's really unfortunate that these phones were ever released before this problem was resolved.If the display worked I would be happy with the phone.  Just having to activate and setup each phone has been a nightmare with Sprint.  The phone is unlocked and I had to buy the sim card online because Sprint stores didn't carry them because the phone was just released.I am angry and frustrated about having to go through this.  I have owned at least 10 cell phones from different companies and have had very few  problems.I can't recommend this phone.

Great Phone!  Missing Wireless Charging but I have a fix for that.
","

  I bought this phone to replace my Samsung S8+.  My Samsung started having issues after 3 years.  I wanted a phone that could compare or be better than my old phone for a $500 or under price tag.  The Motorola Edge has mostly beat the s8+ in every way except for one.  It doesn't offer Wireless Charging.  This however was an easy fix.  I bought a $12 wireless charger receiver that plugged into the usb-c and fit in the case that came with the phone.So now, I'm happy.  The phone is a big upgrade in my opinion and does everything that I need in a phone.  I'm not a power user but I do use many functions of the phone.  Major portions I use, Bluetooth, Texting, Music through Bluetooth, basic games, social media, connecting to work apps, hotspot for kids and work, camera sometimes for kids.Features I love so far:Great Screen with Moveable backgroundNightlight feature.  When I'm searching for the phone at night, I wave my hand over it and it lights up showing me where it is.Great Software.  I love the Android 10 but take the time to learn all the gestures.  Google assistant is nice also.Good network connections - No dropped calls or anything like that.Love the on screen fingerprint reader.  So much better then the old on the back one from Samsung.Great Battery LifeLittle thing but it was nice that it came with a case.  One less thing I needed to go buy.One Dislike so far:Certain apps like Smart News, the articles lines go over the edge and makes it hard to read the article with out tilting the phone.  Very small problem.  S8+ had the edge screen also and it didn't do that.No native Wireless Charging but as I said above, I solved this with a wireless receiver I bought for $12

  My son gave my wife a non Motorola Flagship smartphone with a great camera and my wife has been using Motorola phones since the 80's.  This other Android phone drove her nuts.  All of the Motor exclusive features were sorely missed by her.  Every day since Mother's Day she would hand her Flagship smartphone and ask me to make it work like her old Motorola.  ""I'm sorry honey but that is a patented feature only available on a Motorola phone.""  She loves this phone so much she convinced her friend to buy one too.  Funny because her husband is a retired Motorola Mobile Division marketing guy who still attends Mobile World Congress in Barcelona every year.  Buy this phone!

Pretty dang good phone for $400

  The camera quality for most photos is pretty bad compared to the pixel 2 I had last, but it does have a cool macro close up lens that works fairly well.It's the cheapest phone I found that has 5g, and I'm warming up to the curved screen.The biggest downside is the lack of good case selections

Satisfied with my purchase.

  Bought phone for $499. Have phone - 2 months. Like brightness feature outdoors! Fingerprint reader does fine, unless finger is dirty. Battery life seems to be okay. My battery has to work overtime. And it seems to be holding up. No trouble with phone operation. Edge feature is a bit slippery to pick up from a flat surface. Hope 5G improves overtime. Every once in awhile, have to restart phone due to no 5G reception (AT&T). Comes back on with 4G LTE. 5G shows back up on its own. Like moto actions features - alot! Sound quality is good. I can hear my song, I set for alarm, from shower; in other room.

  The first phone that Amazon sent me ended up having a defected screen that kept blotching up and turning grey on the edges. I requested a replacement and a return label, which they sent me right away.  It was a hassle transferring all the information twice. However, the second phone is working great, and it's 5g capable.  Now, waiting for Verizon to roll it out.  Good thing is this phone is unlocked, and I can take it  to any carrier.Very nice phone, great feel, nice functions.  Working really well. I have always enjoyed Motorola cell phones over the years.  My old Z3 is still working, but worn.

Beware of refurb budget phones. Oem parts cost more than than the phone!
","

  The phone is probably a decent budget phone when it's new. I bought this as a replacement for a much better but also much older phone for a teenager.2 stars because, even for a budget phone, it felt super cheap. Now, I suspect this was most likely due to it being a renewed product. Most often I think refurb phones are OK. In this case though I think whoever fixed up this phone used cheap replacements and did a bad job of it because oem parts would cost almost as much as the phone!. From day one  the phone was nearly unusable due to constant phantom touches all over the screen that would hang up calls, switch between or close apps, and cause the screen to get stuck alternating between the two home screens, like someone frantically swiping left and right on the home screen. Anyway, as I mentioned the phone screen also felt super cheap and it even started to separate along the top edge. Within a couple days the screen also started to crack and what little glue was holding on the screen must have given up because the whole screen (glass, digitizer and lcd) just fell right off. I'm sure this was the exception to the rule but just be aware you stand a better chance of getting a lemon on a refurb/renewed phone.  Better to buy refurb flagship phones. You can get a decent new budget phone for slightly more than this renewed budget phone.Moto G anyone?

It Makes a Rotary Telephone Look Userfreindly In Comparison
","

  I did not buy this phone from amazon, I purchased it from AT&T, when my Samsung Galaxy J10 had an accident and I needed a new phone immediately, which is how I got stuck with this piece if utter garbage.  The salesman who sold it to me seemed positively delighted to get rid of it, that  of course was my first sign that I was getting a lemon, but Windows Vista was by all accounts one lemon of an operating system and I kept it for 5 years and never had much of a problem with it so I figured ""how bad can the phone be?"" Pretty bad.  For starters you can hang up fitting it with a screen protector, it has shed every single screen protector I have fitted it with, this frankly would not be a problem if I had insurance on this phone like I did my other one at this point I would be willing to loose some data just to replace it.  When I was able to get a screen protector to stick to the wretched thing at all for any length of time there was an palpable loss of communication between the screen and my fingers, at first I thought that that was entirely an artifact of the screen protector, until I stopped using them.  The touch screen even without the screen protector is dicey.  If you learned to type on a manual typewriter, or if you had an instructor who learned to type one you might be able to work this thing, without getting word soup, but I doubt it.  If your fingers or rather the tips of your fingers drag at all on the keypad, the wretched phone starts synthesizing words.  As near as I can tell it grabs every key between the one you intended to hit and the one you accidentally hit and creates a word, for what purpose I can only guess but for instance: ""of week of week ci Wynn of"" this is what the idiot device comes up with on it's own.  Sometimes the ""words"" bear no resemblance to actual words, at least not any that I am familiar with, and I am familiar with quote a few words at least in the English language, and sometimes they are actual words just randomly spaced throughout a sentance or paragraph.  If you use you phone for a lot of emails or typing of any sort this gets annoying rather fast as you have to hold yourself to a snail's pace or be prepared to do a lot of editing when you are through, and you have to check over everything you write assiduously because sometimes it is only a few letters added in here and there.  Then there is the clock app, I use my Smart phone as a watch because I have a skin condition that makes wearing an actual watch difficult, the clock on this phone was clearly intended to ONLY be used by humans with 20/20 vision.  It cannot, as far as I have been able to assertain, be made larger, it cannot be relocated anywhere other than the upper lefthand corner of the phone, when I first got the phone I spent over 2 hours trying to move it just to the upper right hand corner with no luck, and the color of the clock display cannot be changed, by the Phone's Owner, the phone occaisionally changes the color of the clock from black to white, and sometimes back again with no discernable pattern, or reason. I have adapted to the minuscule display and the lefthand location, but the alternating colors, particularly the white numbers are driving me crazy.  Finally the phone is not even a good PHONE, it might have been serviceable in the 1980s or 90s when people still employed human receptionists, but in the current era it is a menace.  The screen times out almost the instant your call connects, this is from what I can tell a patch, or a software patch intended to compensate for mechanical problem with the touch screen itself, if by some miraculous coincidence you are able to dissuade the screen from going black the minute the call goes through, is say you begin a conversation on bluetooth and switch to the handset, when you hold the phone to your ear the keypad is either do sensitive, or so poorly placed that your face will hit the numbers and either interrupt your conversation with a continuous stream of discordant beeps, or in the event you are dealing with an automated answering service make a series of inappropriate selections.  If you actually need to make selections on an automated answering service you will usually find that your keypad has been replaced with a blank screen, MOST of the time you can get the screen to reappear by hitting the lock screen button on the side of the phone, but occaisionally this results in the screen actually locking or the phone powering down, both undesirable outcomes if you are in the middle of something.  Customizing ANYTHING on this phone is battle, from the simplist things like clock settings which the phone just won't let you change to default storage locations which the phone seems intent on returning to internal everytime it is restarted or updated.  Additionally though I am not certain if it is problem with the phone or the Operating system this phone has one of the most exasperating spellcheck/autocorrects I have ever encountered.  The autocorrect will occaisionally alter numbers for no discernable reason including regrettably mobile numbers entered into text recipients, I have caught the spellcheck altering passwords twice, courtesy of websites that give you the option of veiwing the password you are typing, and the spellcheck flaggs words that are not misspelled so frequently as to make absolutely useless as a proofreading tool.  I also suspect that the spellcheck has a grammercheck that is indistinguishable from the grammar check, which results in it flagging anything that is grammatically incorrect as misspelled.  Last but not least although most smart phone seem to be entirely screen, with no edge, and therefore nothing to hold onto while you type, this one just seems worse, there is literally nothing to grasp on the edges of this phone that will not do something on the screen that you don't want it to do, I am 90% sure that is why no screen protector no matter what brand or caliber will work on it, there is just nothing for the screen protectors to adhere to to keep them in place.

  Item arrived earlier than expected. Others have noted scratches or other damage. This reconditioned phone was impossible to tell from brand new. Activating through MetroPCS took a simple phone call. Porting everything over from my old phone took all of ten minutes. It is a little smaller than my wife's A20 but that doesn't bother me as it fits in my pocket better. The only complaint is that without a case this phone is very slippery. Also, I would like a longer charging cord. I would definitely recommend buying an aftermarket case along with the phone. Nice phone at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend.

  My boyfriend goes through phones like they are going oiut of style because he is just so clumsy and such that I wanted to get him something that would work well for his needs but also something that wasn't super expensive so that if it was broken like all the rest it wouldn't break the bank. I love Samsung phones so I was happy to come across this one. It was pre-used but there aren't any scratches or anything major with it. They also included a charging cable because it takes a Type C as well as a USB adapter wall plug. They also put in a paper that tells you about the unlocked phone and how to get it to use other carriers chip (I forget what they are called). The only thing I wasn't really happy was that I am pretty sure that it advertised the phone as black and so I bought a black and clear case to go with it however when I got the phone it was actually blue. My boyfriend doesn't care though so we kept it. Other than that pretty happy with it.

  Upgraded from the Stylo 4 after breaking the screen and so far I don't have any complaints.  I've only had the phone for a few days so I'm sorry I can't give a more detailed reviewUPDATE:Now that I've had this phone for a few weeks I can tell you it completely sucks. It seems to have changed all the dates on all my photos to the same date and time.For some reason I can't add apps to the home screen. Apps like Google play have disappeared from home screen and are not listed under hidden apps.the whole gif capture option used to be awesome on the older phone's but now it doesn't let me send the captured gifs to anyone. Constantly says waiting for ""name"" to be online. Normal texts send fine. And everything works sending to myself. And it's not a service issueThe battery life lasts about a dayThe not being able to customize or shut off certain notifications is a real bummer.The screen constantly goes black or freezes regardless of what you're doing so you either need to shut screen off and turn it back on or most of the time do a power off/restartCan't move apps to SD card which forces space to be used which slows phoneI know some of these problems might be minor complaints to some people but for what I use my phone for it's a really sucks.The more issues I have with this phone the more I am less likely to purchase another LG productUpdate 11/13 phone constantly having issues receiving and sending text/picture messages. Trouble making calls phone constantly tells me who I'm calling is not in service bit works fine from other phones on the same carrier.To sum it all up this phone is a complete waste of money. Anyone who purchased this phone should be given a refund or gift card to purchase a new better phone

  Got it about a week ago, already broken. I used the pen twice and it's already stuck halfway in its housing. I have a pen sticking out of the bottom of my phone. I don't think I've ever been more disappointed with a phoneUpdate: I upgraded from a Stylo3, which was fantastic for my needs but was getting a bit old and after a few years, the internal speaker was broken so I had to use external speakers for phone calls. I definitely regret the ""Upgrade"" to the Stylo6.A defect that I didn't notice at first but is now a lot more prominent is the fingerprint reader, the Stylo3 never had an issue but this one can only read my fingerprint 5-10% of the time, mostly it just runs out of 'tries' to read fingerprints and asks me for the passcode, which defeats the whole purpose.

  If your coming from a flagship phone like an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy S you'll notice a difference. This is does most tasks good, but doesn't have a powerful processer. Some things are a little slow to load, not terribly slow but could be faster. Screen is nice but dim, you'll have to turn it up all the way if your in the sun. Camera's are ok with light, won't do good at night. Videos come out ok not the best, will be ok for social media. Stereo speakers are good, not the best sounding but good enough for average user. I haven't made many calls when I did they sounded fine, had to turn volume up high but sounded fine enough to me. I haven't really even used the Stylus, I took it out but it's not anything special, it's just a basic Stylus. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who has had a Samsung Galaxy S or iPhone. Battery is good can last 2 days if you don't use it too much, if not you can get a whole day out of it. This phone is for an average user that doesn't care about taking very many pictures or is a heavy phone user. If your use to a higher end phone I would recommend looking at other options.

  The most important thing to know is this phone comes in multiple versions and have different specs depending on where you buy it from and which cell phone company it is branded for. The best of the bunch is the one that comes with 4gb RAM and 64gb internal memory. It is a bit more expensive, but it is worth it. The one that that most people are writing reviews about is the 3gb RAM one which is of course slower.

  So I ordered this phone and it was advertised as unlocked. I went to verizon to activate it and they tell me it’s not unlocked and the only way to find out it’s carrier is to call every carrier until you find the correct one. So I find the correct carrier (AT&T) and buy a SIM card set it up and for some unknown reason my internet will not work without WiFi. I have data, no reason for this. It’s been a week and the problem has yet to be solved. I bought this because my previous phone completely crapped out on me. I’d send this phone back but I can’t be without a phone due to work. Still trying to figure this out but I recommend contacting the seller of any iPhone you are interested in buying before hand to receive all the information that is not advertised and to make sure their advertising is accurate.

PHONE WORKED FOR A 4 DAYS.. PLEASE READ!!
","

  Bought phone to use with T-mobile. All was good for the first few days till my daughter noticed it wasn't going on internet anymore or receiving / making calls. Called T-mobile to try and fix since it was a service issue, but they exhausted their options on trying to solve problem and suggested I call Apple instead. Apple tech support also exhausted their options. They mentioned to me that according to the serial #, the phone is a part of the first bunch sent out when the phone was first made that had some kind of defect, that they will replace it with a new one on an even exchange. Sent my phone in to apple, only to have it sent back to me with the email (see photo attached) saying that since the phone has 'unauthorized modifications' they will not send me a new one. Immediately got my refund, and went to t-mobile instead to buy the same 7 for $60 more, BRAND NEW, no modifications, no troubles. The description section will sell you a dream. SAVE YOUR MONEY.

Warranty

  I purchased a refurbished Iphone7 on Sept.16, 2018. The phone I received did not work so I sent it back for a replacement. The replacement phone was not working properly either.

They took the 30 day warranty from the first phone instead of the 2nd, even though the first phone did not work. Beware!

Not Unlocked!! Do Not Buy!!!
","

  The cosmetic portion of this phone is practically flawless.  Unfortunately that’s where the positive remarks end. For whatever reason Amazon has decided to sell phone that is not unlocked. Therefore you can only use it with the network it is locked to unless the network that it is locked to will unlock it for you. This particular phone was locked to Verizon wireless. So I contacted Verizon wireless to set up a plan. They told me it was not locked to them however their network is the only one that will work on this phone. The phone was locked to AT&T. I called AT&T and they refused to unlock it without the original passcode was given. Amazon what the hell is wrong with you?!?!?!

Low quality

  Definition of ""renewed"" is very narrow since it obviously doesn't include a new battery.  Phone arrived with a battery that ""required service"" according to the error code.  Full charge only provides 5-6 hours of use.  Customer service offered to take return, but of course I would be without a phone at that point.  Refused to send another one which is a common way to handle this type of problem (I would return this one after another received).  Also, annoying that I will have to spend time setting up another phone.  Finally, they could have offered me a credit to go get the battery replaced.  Very dissatisfied with phone and vendor.

BEWARE-Battery needs replacing. New biattery not including in refurbishing with this seller!
","

  Update: Phone overheats just from being on. My daughter can’t be on the phone for more than 30 mins without the battery dropping to 10%, and needing to be charged again. Buyer beware! Not worth it. After I spent the money on this phone, I then spent money setting it up with a new SIM card, then paid for a new number&plan and added it to my no contract AT&T account for my oldest daughter. After I completed the set up over the phone with my carrier, I was FINALLY able to get into the settings on the phone, and I ended up checking the battery life. It’s at 73% RIGHT OFF THE BAT! Seriously?! If you’re going to sell refurbished iPhones, part of that refurbishing is replacing the battery! My daughter said to me the very next morning “The battery goes down really fast. I don’t leave anything open on it but it drains pretty fast, is that normal?” I now have to spend 49.00(estimated online price) at an Apple store, to get a new battery. FYI: You can’t check the battery life until you set up the phone, otherwise I would of checked it before setting it up, and I would of returned it. Now I’m stuck buying a new battery, on top of wasting MORE money on gas and time to drive to an Apple store some 20 miles from me. If I HAD known, I would of paid a little extra for a phone with a good battery. I WAS going to buy 3 more phones for Xmas, for my other 3 teens,but not from this seller. I’ll be buying from a different seller from now on, and it’s too bad, because I really wanted this to be a good buy. I will be asking for battery life % before buying now. I do not recommend unless you want to replace the battery right away. Not worth the money or aggravation. They did ship it in within the time frame though.

  UPDATE: so I was just notified I got 100 helpful thumbs up on this review and thought I should update it.... yeah, no. The phone lasted two months. It shut completely off one day, wouldn’t turn back on, nothing. Went to get it checked, and was told it was fried. I lost so many photos and notes because apparently it never uploaded to icloud. The only reason I’m giving it two stars was because I got the refund.ORIGINAL: I was extremely skeptical, as I have always bought contracted new phones from att, but I wanted to get off their plan and I was just done with my old iPhone 5s which had completely given up on me. However, as a college student, I couldn’t afford to buy straight from Apple so I checked OfferUp and letgo, and when those seemed wayyy to sketchy I came to amazon and found this.It took me a week to finally come to terms on buying a refurbished phone off the internet, but I am so glad I did! First off, the battery life is ridiculous; I charge my phone about every TWO days. Also, unlocked made it really easy to switch to metro pcs. I love the Live Photo’s! I love the size (I have small hands, but with a pop socket, it’s perfect)! I also love being able to take it out on the boat and not worry about it getting wet!Love love love that I took the chance to buy it!

Don’t purchase if you live outside the US, if not working properly you will be inconvenienced

  I bought this phone from DeCluturr store,  a friend collected in the  US and brought it for me to Barbados, the phone works perfectly, minor scratches, however,the hearing piece and speakers are extremely extremely low! Inorder to hear, calls always have to be put on loud speaker, or listen through a headset, which does not come with the phone, so you have to purchase one. Tried asking the seller to assist by helping me to get the phone fix on my end and they refuse to assist, all they insist is that i you return the phone, not caring that it will cost me almost the same amount to send the product back to them. My advise to anybody if you are living out of the US don’t purchase these phones online, especially if you are  not intending to visit the states before the warranty is up, cause the amount of money to send these stuff back, best you go to the store and purchase a new phone and some of these sellers don’t care about your inconvenience.

Almost 3 months later...

  I purchased this phone on 2/26/20. Barely 3 months later, this phone no longer works for calls. I first believed it was the SIM card. I took the SIM card out and inserted it into an older iPhone, and it worked fine. I tried various things and have come to the conclusion that it is a faulty iPhone. I should have returned it when I first noticed that a small corner of the screen did not work. I ignored it since this phone was for my young daughter to get a reach of me after school. I regret purchasing this and should have paid full price for a brand new iPhone.

It's alright
","

  At first glance, the phone is in perfect condition. No scratches. Set up was easy. However, after using it for about 2 weeks, I have noticed some defects. The battery healths maximum capacity is at 86%, it should be at 100%. Siri doesn't work, it doesn't let me set it up. Wifi turns itself off sometimes and does not let you turn it on. Calls will either not go through or will sound static-y, low, like is the person was far away. I have also been told that they can't really hear me on their side. Video calls don't work sometimes like FaceTime and Facebook's Messenger's video calls. I have to turn it off and on because it decides to act up. Just today, after having it for 2 weeks, the battery started dying faster than usual. That is all I can think of right now. I will update if something else acts up.Edit: Ended up returning it a week after submitting this post.

NOT Very good deal!

  I got this phone for myself after my old phone broke. It came in a day earlier than what amazon said. It was shipped with FedEx. The phone comes in simple packaging. Mines had some light scratches on the screen but nothing that you can see when it is on during normal use. The phone had a Bluetooth issue at first but apple customer support had me update the IOS from 13.2 to 13.3 and everything is fine now. My biggest complaint (which is minimal) is that the battery was said to be at 80% health (from amazon's renewed product statement) but mines showed at 78% percent (no big deal for me). Overall, this was a great buy and recommend to anyone who wants a budget phone.Edit: after having this phone for a little over a month, the cellular has stopped working and apparently a big issue on iphone 7's and the phone keeps restarting. Returned. Your milage may vary.

We contacted the company who promptly responded giving us several options. We could return for full refund, we could return and they would send a different one, or we could take it to an authorized Apple repair to replace the battery.We chose to replace the battery. We then sent them the receipt to which they promptly refunded the battery replacement cost same day!Over all we are highly satisfied with this company. They stand behind what they advertise and they promptly fix any mistakes that occur.In my experience the good companies are not the ones who don’t mess up but are the ones who quickly offer solutions and do everything they can to fix mistakes when they happen.

Good budget phone

  I got this phone to replace my Note 4 (which died due to the infamous emmc error). I was looking for a budget phone something around $200 and the Moto G8 power fits the bill perfectly. I use it on T-Mobile which is a GSM network without issues.Pros :Excellent battery life - I use my smartphone more like a dumb phone (basically talk and text), battery easily lasts for a week without having to recharge.Screen - Sharp and VividFingerprint scanner works without issuesBloatfree Android 10 OS - Mostly stockSuper fast charging with the included Turbo chargerBudget friendlyLTE works without issuesHaven't noticed any major lag (but then again, my use case for the phone are pretty light)ConsNo NFC - I don't really use my phone for payment2.4 Ghz Wifi - The phone lacks 5 Ghz Wifi, this is a problem because often times my Bluetooth headset interferes with the 2.4 Ghz Wifi. Having the bluetooth headset turn on and connected causes the phone to disconnect Wifi.

A massive upgrade from the Moto G7 Power!
","

  I was going to hold off upgrading from my Moto G7 power, but after looking at the specs of the G8 edition I decided to pull the trigger and upgrade. I'm sure glad I did!Compared to the base Moto G7 Power you're getting a superior rear facing camera setup, pin hole front facing camera, sharper screen, more screen real estate, dual speakers, faster processor, more RAM and more internal storage. I also paid the same price as I did for the G7 Power. Upgrading is a no brainier!Despite the full HD screen and beefier processor, I hardly have seen much of a difference in battery life from last year's model.Forget those insanely expensive flagship phones! If you want the best dollar to feature phone, get a Moto G8 Power!

Worst phone ever!
","

  I bought this to replace my son's phone. He had the Moto G8 Plus so this was a big downgrade but as long as he had all his games he didn't care. The built in memory on his old phone was 64GB, this only has 16 GB so I decided to buy an SD card so he could have more apps. This phone does not allow you to expand the memory for apps, the sd card can only transfer pictures and other files. After inserting the sd card, the whole phone has been malfunctioning. I did a factory reset 3 times and still malfunctioning. A complete waste of money. 16 GB is not enough space given that the system memory already takes up 6.4 GB only leaving you with 9.6 GB.

DONT BUY THIS PHONE ON TOTAL WIRELESS
","

  what a piece of junk. what horrible customer service.  What a cursed relic from some ancient land.1) after over 4 hours on the phone with customer service trying to activate my second A01 (first one i had to return) the tech told me they have been having problems with samsung phones. he said A01, A20, and A10e. btw. still not activated.2) i bought a motorola g7 for my daughter through total wireless. it actually had some issue that took them 30 minutes to fix but for the price of phone and service and the coverage well worth it. so i bought the A01 before christmas from amazon.  christmas day we tried to activate it online, no dice.  so the next day i called. i spent an hour on the phone with someone in india who barely spoke english after an hour of shutting my phone off and saying “im sorry for the wait sir but im fixing the problem on my end” every 2 minutes he claimed he found the problem. gave me a ticket number and said to wait 4 hours and the phone should work. 4 hours later nothing changed so i call back. different indian woman, worse connection, and she has no record of my ticket number. after going through the same crap, i reset the phone as she claims she fixed it... then we get disconnected. i called back different indian guy, still cant find the ticket. no record of my call and im losing my $&@!  i go full karen ask for a manager while transferring i get disconnected again. (im not making this up). so i call back after some deep breathing exercises and a walk.  i get through to a manager who sounds suspiciously like just another rep. i get the same script and finally after almost 4 hours in 2 days on the phone they tell me something is wrong with the sim card and its already registered to another person. they need 24 hours to fix the issue.  spoiler i didnt fix it. so then they claim to have found the issue and at that point i figured it was the phone. i called amazon they agreed to send me a replacement (see cursed item below) eventually i get January 6th. i finally work up the nerve to call snd try to activate it. this time i get a lovely girl from another land who seems to have a great connnection and my account gets set up, no sim card issues but no network connection. ill spare you the recap 4 hours, 2 days, 4 disconnects and 1 guy threatening to hang up on me cus i was upset about being hung up on  they finally admit they are having a software issue between total wireless and samsung, and have been getting no response from samsung. as i write this im on hold with a manager demanding a refund and he has no record of the previous calls, is having me restart the phone again and claims there is no reported issues with these phones!3) all that would be a sign that this wasnt meant to be. but add in that when i ordered the phone from amazon it was supposed to be 3 day shipping. it took 3 weeks, barely came before christmas. then when they did they exchange they promised 2 day shipping right before new year. i didnt get it til like the 7th or 8th only after multiple calls to amazon did they admit the driver lost the package and only then did they reorder it.do not order this phone for total wireless! even at current prices or free it would not be worth it.look you get what you pay for and i expected customer service to be the big trade off but this is ridiculous.  my daughters phone works great. we had coverage issues with tmobile prepaid networks so total wireless being verizon was appealing and has worked out. but the samsung AO1 will expose you to the worst customer service experience ever.

This set has no redeeming qualities, it fails on every front
","

  Pros - easy to return.Cons:1-Poor call quality.2-Made super cheaply.3-Headset is an absolute joke. Hands down the single worst headset I have ever seen. All of the bands and so on are made so cheaply that they are bent out of shape by my ear. I have normal ears, btw. I tried the over the ear attachment for the headset, and they actually managed to mess that up as well. It would not fit around my head, it was too small. I don't have a fat head, either.4-Sure it hooked up to my cell phone, whoopie. Since even the landline calls on this thing sounded worse than my cell phone, this proved to be worthless as well.5-Each line picked up the other, as well as those of my neighbors. Given that DECT was made for apartment buildings with hundreds of tenants, I was surprised by this, to say the least.So here is a phone, with a headset, that is using DECT in order to mitigate noise from other electronics. Call quality is abysmal, the headset is an insult to whomever they sell it to, and they actually found a way to make DECT fail.I try to be fair in my reviews, but if this thing made it through quality control, this is probably a stock to short sell. Yes, it was that bad. I not only want my refund, I want the 3 hours of my life this wasted back. Absolute piece of garbage.

Poor user interface/Poor reception
","

  From the start, the first few callers said the reception was poor. I had installed the phone on a Saturday and support was only available during weekdays. First red flag. I did call on Monday and to my surprise, did not have to wait very long for a support person, who suggested I move the phone, which is connected by a standard phone jack  closer to the wall connection.  After which she said the reception improved.  Since then, about half my callers have volunteered that the reception was poor. Second red flag.  The phone has some interesting bells and whistles, but it was difficult to get them to work.  Example: You can get your contact information to transfer from you cell phone.  And I did it, I think?, but I could not get access to the contacts.  I put a few numbers into Phone book, but again could not figure how to get access to them.In order to get to the cell phone for the transfer, I had to make a blue tooth connection, but it was annoying when both phones would now ring at the same time and I could not figure out how to disconnect them.  I have a degree in Systems Engineering and do understand how electronics work, and in my opinion, this phone is poorly designed. Even making a dialed phone call was problematic.  The last straw was another  caller saying that reception was poor, so I am sending it back.

  Poor Sound quality is not acceptable for a business phone system. Really not good quality. When I am using the phone, everyone complains of an echo, I plugged in a 10 buck cheapo phone and everyone thinks its much better. Let me go into more specifics.When using the handset, you get an echo. I can even hear the echo. If you tap the phone around, even slightly, its like an echo cannon on other people. Horrible, Did anyone test this?The hands free earpiece. This gives acceptable quality, BUT again if you make any noise near one of the bases it picks that up and adds it into the mix. How can this be okay?For a phone that claims to be noise cancelling, this is the opposite! It echo amplifies everything. Total waste of money.Purchased under a month ago, and I dont see a way to return it either so I guess I get to fight with the manufacturer.IF YOU VAULE VOICE QUALITY FOR YOUR CLIENTS, DO NOT GET THIS!Other issues.The recorded messages have to be played at the base station, on speaker. This is not good when you have people leaving confidential messages.The fit of the handset on the base, is far from perfect. It has a gap. Not that this is important in itself, but its not as pictured.

So very disappointed!Called customer support but they’re closed (at noon on Thursday) because of the Christmas  holiday tomorrow!Both units are going back to AmazonUpdate: I found the headset battery at the bottom of the box. Nothing in the box is labeled but something told me to turn the box over and shake it to see if I missed anything. Out dropped the tiny (1”) headset battery.The headset cradle charging prongs on the 1st unit were bent, leading me to think someone else struggled to hang the headset. It was obvious that the box contents had been removed and repackaged.It may seem like common sense to some but less technical and older adults struggle with setting up new products. Nothing should be assumed or steps skipped in manuals.Most of the negative reviews complain about the quality of the headset. I need to use it multiple times daily and hope it’s up to the challenge.

  Overall it is a nice Phone. I have a similar one at work. It does not stay paired with my cell phone. I have done everything the manual said to do. I had a Panasonic system and it always reconnected when my phone was in range so it’s not the cell phone. Also it does not send SMS (text) messages to my hand set or even beep when I get a text. It would be nice if just once something (that was Droid based) actually did what it was advertised to do. I wish Apple would make something like this. You can see in the unit’s menu there is no provisioning for SMS or any other messaging functions. I did set up the Connect to Cell app and had it handle SMS.

  I may return this, I haven't decided yet.Before I start I will say, i don't use the cell phone/bluetooth part of this.For context, I work from home. it isn't uncommon for me to spend several hours per day on the phone. Most of it with my business partner as we discuss workload, action plans etc.My main reason for buying this was because it came with a headset. I'm converting from a sip phone system (Cisco SPA 525g) and an ungodly expensive Plantronics headset (the headset cost 3 times more than this entire VTech system)I've found the range on the headset and phone to be great and more than enough to walk anywhere in my house, including the garage and out the perimeter of my yardThere are a few things i dislike but overall i'm currently on the fence. There are some pretty fundamental things that should be reviewed.For one, the buttons being flush mount just seems odd. I guess they're trying to give it a look like a touch screen but I don't want that. I like separated, raised buttons. Just a whiny complaint I know.The headset works well, I'll have to follow up with discussion on talk time, i haven't used it enough yet, but believe me I will. I'm not thrilled about the way it fits in my ear. i can't get it secure.One issue I have is the phone book. They really missed the mark with this. It's awful. it takes forever to scroll back and forth (excuse me, up and down). and if you use the keys to find an entry, it pauses for a very long time before it searches for the entriesPROS:Range is greatPhones hold charge for a long timePhone book is centralized (enter once and it propagates to all handsets) Though this could be a CON for a multi person familyVolume on headset is very good.CONSbuttons are flush, it sounds silly but it's annoying.Charge light is dimon screen display text is thin and very small. reminds me of something from the 90sBacklight is dim and I can't find a way to change itMute button on headset is in very awkward positionButton for headset is hard to find while wearing.Phone Book is painful to scroll. they really need more power in this thing. it's very crude

Nice looking set with good range but interference and poor battery life
","

  This phone replaced an older model from a different company that was starting to die after about 5 or 6 years of use. Generally speaking, it's a decent phone with good range and sound clarity. The set is also very nice looking, with a modern and streamlined appearance.However, I have two complaints -I use it in a home office setting and though I had high hopes for the headset, its battery life doesn't seem that good and if I forget to put it on the charger overnight, I have to scramble to get to the actual handset after realizing the headset is dead.Secondly, the speakerphone generally works well. Unfortunately, it also works well at getting interference. If I put the speaker phone on and lay the phone on my desk in front of my computer, there's a distinct buzzing sound that can turn into a shrill whine if it gets too close to my wireless keyboard. My previous phone had no issues whatsoever with this placement, which makes it frustrating for both me and those I talk to. Even talking off speaker phone, getting too close to electronics can cause a similar buzzing.This had the potential to be a really great home office setup, but limitations on the headset battery and interference on the handset make it at best a mediocre buy.

Acceptable but there were and are some problems.
","

  I received the VTech DS6771-3 DECT 6.0 expandable system promptly after submitting my order.  My ancient phone system had malfunctioned.  I am unable to use my cell phone in every corner of my home and so required urgent replacement.  The rapid delivery was great.Installation was quick and easy, and I was pleased to see it functioning as promised.  Besides that, the sound is clearer than in the ancient system I had replaced.But … there are some problems:1. The sealed package was incomplete.  Although the cordless headset (or at least part of it)  was included, the battery for it was not.  It’s useless now.  I find no way to order a single replacement battery for the cordless headset and choose not to spend the $40 for a new, separate one.  I can’t return the whole system to Amazon for a replacement because that would leave me without a home phone for too long so I'm stuck with this incomplete system.2.  As I reported, my cell phone did connect easily.  It will be a pleasure carrying around only one phone and having access to cell phone calls in remote corners of my basement.  The contact list on my Samsung S10 cell phone, though, has failed all attempted downloads. Despite the promises, I’ll have to enter a contact list by hand.3. Additional handsets requested on a separate order were planned for delivery today.  I’ve learned now it might be delayed, potentially three more days.4. The handsets cannot be renamed.  I’m stuck remembering that #1 is the base system, #2 is the kitchen, the soon to come #3 will be the… and it goes on.I’ve had the system for only 2.5 days.  I can’t attest to the durability and will modify this review if need be.  As noted, the system’s OK but there are some problems.  It is for this that I cannot give this purchase great review.If you don’t care about headsets, if you don’t mind entering contacts manually and if you don’t mind potential lengthy delays when ordering and waiting for additional handsets, this system is fine.  If those are important, you might want to look elsewhere.

Not sure about it quite yet...

  Edit: I ended up just sending it back. I don't have time to fiddle with trying to make Caller ID to work on it when it should by default. The service is there; other phones work fine with Caller ID, but this one simply would only say Home Line Call every time I'd get a call. No go.I'm just using this phone as a office phone within a hospital. I don't need really any special things for a phone, just as long as it works when making calls and cordless is nice. We have a phone system actually which controls are voice mails etc... Our provider and ;phone system passes caller ID info; however, this Vtech phone will not show it. When any number calls it simply says ""Home Line Call"" as the incoming number. Very frustrating as I must have caller ID show up due to high volumes of SPAM calls. If I cannot get it to work, I will return this. It seems most of the Vtechs our facility gets has this problem. Other phones like AT&T and RCA seem to work great with the caller ID without any further setup. Oh and people on the other end say they hear static on my line, but I don't hear any. This could either be due to the mic on this phone works so good it picks up the background noise or it's messed up; I don't know yet.

Cost does matter about 'quality' =[

  Being disabled & on a fixed very limited income, i try to save whenever possible. Sometimes (like 'this time'), was unfortunately LOW price & LOW quality =[  yes, the phone functions, or it would have been returned before getting past the 'time limit' to return! This should not have to be 'rocket science' to produce a product worthy it's cost!!!  Besides the extremely small font in the display, battery's in headsets very short strength time, not certain if they perform as stated, is moot. and the actual numbers to press on the keypad are nicely illuminated yet super difficult pressing strong enough to register (without including one of the others around it) =[ in my opinion, this is priced twice as much as quality =[

  OK Product. Sound quality on speaker phone is terrible. Other party always reports lot of buzzing sound. Sound is OK on the phone; fairly clear. The headset is pretty good except for the mute feature. A lady speaks ""Mute On""; "" Mute Off"" effectively cancelling out anyone speaking in the background. Sometimes you miss whatever was said when you toggle the mute.Overall 3*--a lot of features that are provided for the prices; Primarily got it for the headset which is also fine but by no means a product that is user friendly and well designed. I would not purchase again.

DEVICE COUNT
","

  The description states that the base is expandable to five devices.  I purchased this unit, which includes 2 handsets, and 3 additional handsets knowing that I then had five handsets (devices).  I made the mistake of assuming that it would work with five handsets. However, what is not clear in the product description is that the headset is considered to be one of the five devices. So now I have an extra handset that I cannot use link up to the base station and is therefore useless. Had this been made clear I would have either purchased a base that would accommodate six devices or I would not have purchased the extra handset. UPDATE: Amazon has authorized my return of one handset.

Not as good as I hoped

  Today I was using the headset for only a few minutes and it already began beeping at me the battery was low. It had been on the charger up until I used it, I'm hoping it was just a fluke and put it back on the charger to try it again later. I also use my phone for work and twice now I've attempted to use it with WebEx and when it called into my home the phone said ""no line"" and wouldn't allow me to pick up the call. My last phone, same company fizzled out too so I'm beginning to wonder about this brand. =/

  The phone seems fine put the main desk top is to0 hard to read the buttons because it's small and it sits upright instead of flat. I have to pick the whole base up to find the message playback button. If you set it on a four foot counter it probably would be better or on your desk while you are sitting down. I have it in my living room where most the furniture is about 36 to 40 inches tall.

  I can't speak to all the bells and whistles on this phone as I do not use them. I just wanted a good looking phone that had an answering machine.

I really like the phone but needs better directions how to make a call on the wireless headset.
","

  So far so good.  I work from home a couple days a week and tend to spend several hours on the phone.  I LOVE having a wireless headset.  I can't believe nobody has incorporated Bluetooth into land lines without needing to connect a cell phone.  The reason I have a land line is because I don't have good cell reception at home.  So having found this phone has been great.I haven't had any issues with anything breaking on the wireless headset.  But there are two reasons for not giving it 5 stars:1. The instructions are horrible regarding the wireless headset.  It was very difficult to figure out how to make a call.  You have to pick up the handset and dial as usual and then you can connect the head set.  You can then hang up the handset without it hanging up the phone.  But you are not on the wireless headset, putting the phone back in the cradle will end the call.  None of this was in the instructions.  There was nothing about making a call with the wireless.2. The earpiece is very uncomfortable to me.  But they included an over-the-head part that you can put the wireless headset into and that works great.The sound quality isn't the best on the wireless but its not enough to make me stop using it.  Overall I'm pretty happy at this price point.

Good but missing features.

  As title says! I wish it had the same features as the others do from this same brand. I had replaced an older, sleeker model of this phone brand and that phone would say the callers name aloud when it rang. This one does not. Can seem lazy to some to need this feature but believe me when you have your hands tied or are ill etc and getting up for the phone is not always an easy feat, that feature matters to you. That being said however, Ive had the phone for months now and it works quite well. My favorite feature of this phone is by far the Bluetooth headset that it comes with. It makes multitasking fairly simple while on the phone.

  I love this phone! Sounds great. Easy to use. Bought more phones and they connect easy. I love the Bluetooth feature. I use it with my cell. When my cell rings and I'm away from it the phone rings differently so I know it's a cell call and you answer on the home phone. That is really cool!!! It has a cell button Seperate from home phone button to answer. And the headset is awesome to talk and do housework at the same time.  Love it. Highly recommend! I don't understand why people say the directions are hard to understand they can't be any more easier. I had this phone working in minutes with the directions so I have no idea what people are reading or maybe they don't understand how to read directions. This phone is awesome. And if you want your cell to work with the phone you have to leave your Bluetooth on on your cell phone. If you don't have your Bluetooth turned on on your cell phone then you're not going to receive calls. This phone does not deserve anything less than 5 stars and reading some of the other comments I don't get it at all why anybody would give it less than 5. It's simple to hook up instructions can not be any more easier!!!!

  These phones work well. I received more than I expected. (I probably should have just read the full phone description.) The phone links to my Vonage VOIP service.

I have not even explored the other features. I was able to download my phonebook from my cell downloaded to the handsets when I linked the Bluetooth.

Just what we wanted
","

  We've been using this VTech phone for two months now and are very pleased with it.  We bought it because we didn't want to get rid of our landline and rely exclusively on our mobile, as many of our friends have done.  (The idea of dragging it around our three-story house all the time exhausted us just thinking about it.)  This phone synchs seamlessly with our mobile and in effect acts as a three-headset extension of it.  The earpiece is also very handy, because you CAN drag that around with no effort, so you always have access to both the landline and the mobile if you want it.  I'm also impressed with the clarity of the sound, both transmitting and receiving.  It's not perfect.  Programming it requires a fair amount of work (though it's not hard) and the LCD screen is a bit hard to read.  Also, the synched mobile will only ring on the headsets if you get an ordinary mobile call, not something like a WhatsApp call.  Overall, though, a great purchase.

  This replaced my 15 year old wireless phone and the difference is amazing. There is so much utility wrapped up in this device that it may be a little daunting at first but, after some fiddling, it is very powerful.  I just transferred 114 contacts from my cell phone.  Please note that there are at least 3 similar vtech systems on Amazon.  This appears to be the newest version and has features that the others don't.

Don't do it!

  I gave this phone a shot after watching multiple videos and reading alot of reviews. I shouldn't have listened to any of them. After a couple weeks I couldn't deal with it anymore. The dual screen is a cool idea but a pain. It's huge and bulky and unused most of the time because it just makes the phone too big to be comfortable. The dual screen would also randomly decide to turn on when I would open the phone. The fingerprint scanner almost never works. I tried redoing my print multiple, multiple times and still wouldn't work accurately so I'd reverted back to using a pin. That still didn't matter because the screen was terrible at registering touch. After just a couple weeks it bogged down and was horribly slow. Tons of lag between apps and actions. The camera is meh. Battery is decent. I changed back to my pixel 2xl with a shattered screen with chunks of glass falling out of it because it still works better than this one and it's 2 years old. Definitely never getting another LG phone.

No matter how many times I recalculated my finger print it was still very slow and often times didn't work.The Dual screen case would sometimes just not work.  Clean the port out still no success.  Turn the phone off and back on, still no success.  Then randomly a few hours or days later its working.The cameras were great.Listening to music over bluetooth in my car and trying to unlock my phone would randomly cause it to shut off.  tried factory reset 3 times.  4 different music apps 5 different devices still unlocking the phone would randomly shut it off.The keyboard would randomly decide it wanted to play peek a boo while I was typing.And lastly For a period of about 3 days before I finally decided I couldn't take anymore with this phone, it would not send or receive texts from certain individuals.  FOR HOURS AT A TIME.  Then it would cluster them all together.  This caused alot of problems for me.Please I know the dual screen is tempting but I DO NOT recommend this phone.

I returned it after 2 days - mostly because of the screen and patch frequency
","

  I liked the idea of this phone, and from the specs it should have blown my previous one out of the water, so it would have been a win either way even if i didn't like the two screens (which make the phone rather clumsy to carry around and operate). And the displays look brilliant - great colors, very bright outside. But what killed it for me was an odd flicker when you scroll websites or other screens. Where it's supposed to be a smooth one-directional movement, it's actually jittery and causes me distinct discomfort (headache).  For someone less sensitive to that it this phone may be a really interesting option, although I found three main things I didn't like on top of the headaches:1) The fingerprint reader is... finicky, and also  a front fingerprint reader is just so much less ergonomic than a back one. I hadn't realized how much more natural the back ones are to use vs the front ones.2) Why, oh why did they have to make the front of the dual-screen cover glass (or clear-glaslike plastic) - if you use it folded open, part of your hand rests against it and it always feels like something you shouldn't be touching. They should have made that side feel more like the back of the case with a cut-out for the little lcd screen.3) It's currently on the April 2020 Security patch for Android 10. No useful information could be gained from LG as to when more recent patches will be available. The website they pointed me to didn't even mention the April update and was still claiming the February was the latest. That's really a no-go.The battery time, especially with the second screen active is nothing to write home about, despite the large-ish battery. The screens just eat it up.Things I actually  liked are the basic dual-screen functionality, especially in the Whale browser, and the camera. The pictures look great and the wide-angle is neat, and having the picture show up immediately in the gallery on the second screen is quite nice.Overall, there's a lot of potential in the basic design idea, but it needs some more work to become a reason to buy a phone like this.

If you want a big combine screen go get the Note Fold. I love this phone so far in term of practical uses. Beside, when I don't want the dual screen, I can easily fold down one screen or even remove it completely. If you do a lot of multitasking (email, Excel, research, etc.) this phone is a dream. If you just want to watch video on a huge screen then this is not.One thing LG can improve on this phone is adding the Face Unlocked option, i hate the built in fingerprint as it's only works 80% of the time. Also LG if you read this, PLEASE change the side button into an ON/OFF button for the second screen. I find it's more useful than to bring up the Google search.

LG G8X ThinQ the perfect phone to multi task, even with a few imperfections.
","

  Here is my review of the LG G8X ThinQ:I have had this phone for a month now and while I have had some minor frustrations with the LG G8X ThinQ...the pros far outweigh the cons. The phone itself is beautiful and sleek, constructed of front (Gorilla Glass 6), back (Gorilla Glass 5), and an aluminum frame. The battery has been ample to get me through my daily tasks and still have power to spare when I get home. The sound is great...I prefer to use wired head phones to take advantage of the LG 32Bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC & DTS: X Virtual Surround. There is plenty of storage with 128 GB internal capacity, but I also added a 1TB microSD card to allow for additional storage of large graphic files for work. While at first I had to invent things to use the second screen for, now I use it every day to multi-task between social media apps...copy & paste is so easy, no constant switching of apps...I love the second screen. Using the second screen does add some heft to the overall device weight, but it was very easy to adjust to the change.The major item of concern is the in-display fingerprint sensor. It is far from accurate, requires more force than a traditional physical finger print sensor & often does not recognize my finger print at all. There have been multiple times I have had to delete and re-enter my finger print completely...which still did not solve the problem. It seems to be more of an issues after the phone sits for a long period of time between uses OR after the phone has been powered off for a period of time. Hopefully LG will correct this with future software updates.Everything considered, I am very happy with the LG G8X ThinQ. It provides more screen space for use without the $2000+ price tags of other phones. It has a solid performing specs well above some flagship phone that cost twice as much. It is great for all of my business and personal needs. (I'll update this review later with additional thoughts!)PROS:- Affordable two screen solution for multi-tasking, watching media or gaming.- Top notch chipset the 855 Snapdragon & 6GB of ram...perfect for whatever you need to do.- 6.4-inch screens with Full HD+ OLED display (2,340 x 1,080 resolution).- Phone comes in one storage size of 128GB, expandable up to 2TB with microSD.- 4,000 mAh battery provides ample charge for single or dual screen use.- Has a 3.5mm head phone jack to take advantage of the LG 32Bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC & DTS: X Virtual Surround.- Has Fast Charging QC 4.0 + Wireless ChargingCONS:- In-display fingerprint sensor is far from accurate.- Second screen is great, but adds additional bulk/weight to an already hefty phone.- Limited apps to take full advantage of the dual screen, at this point

Great Dual Screen With Some Issues
","

  After receiving this product, setting it up, and going over the features, I have a few pros and cons.I got this on sale for $699.99.It comes with two screens which are quite handy for multi-tasking apps. It does not scratch unlike the Samsung Fold, I had that phone as well and this is much more practical with current technology.There are some dual screen apps, and gaming ability, but not very many support the platform.There is a learning curve when figuring out how to use the keyboard ability on one screen. I would advise looking up tutorials and reviews on youtube for this, this is how I learned.The ability for one screen to act as a keyboard, or a gamepad, and the other as the actual app screen is great!A con would be that when you exit all apps on the extra screen it will also exit, or visa versa, I do not think there is a way to undo this.Another con would be that there arent many game apps, or other apps, that support the dual screen function.The wide view allows you to view the same page across both screens, but there is a disconnect where the image shows and is partly cut out on the next screen.Great phone for the price, I got it on sale so that was definitely a game changer for me. At $699 for a phone that only has 128 GB storage and 6 GB Ram with the dual screen is a definite good deal, anything higher I would recommend probably waiting due to most android phones and flagship phones having higher Ram due to the demand from apps. 6GB of ram for a dual screen phone does not seem to be sufficient enough, but it does work great for my needs.

Best phone on the market for multitasking.
","

  To cut a long story short, if you want the multitasking of folding phone get the LG G8X.Pros:-Works with Verizon SIM cards-Dual screen functionality is fantastic-The case the phone comes with is durable. I dropped it while getting out of my car. It fell on a gravel driveway covered with ice and snow. When I looked it over it didn't have a scratch and continues to work great!-SD card support up to 1TB-Dedicated headphone jack.Cons:-The dual-screen support, I've been told by developers, uses proprietary software. This means home screen replacements like Nova Launcher or backgrounds from Tapet will only work on the phone screen and not the case screen.-I occasionally have notifications I can't remove, even if I force stop the app. It's only been a chronic issue with the Google Podcasts app.-If you use a Fitbit, you may experience difficulty setting up your device. The most recent LG phones Fitbit claims to support are the G6 and V10. Fitbit claims that Android has too much hardware diversity for them to be able to support every device. I fault Fitbit for their lack of support rather than LG, but still something to consider if you use a Fitbit device.Final thoughts:I was initially worried about my purchase. I thought I was buying a gimmick phone and I'd regret buying it. I'm glad to say that the phone has won me over and I highly recommend it.

I love the dual screen, charginng dongle sucks
","

  So far so good.  You can't beat the price.  Everything works as it should.  The only thing is that the charging dongle will be easy to lose.  I have just recently lost mine and will be purchasing it from LG.  The dongle is strong so it is harder to pull out.  But, if you lift it up or to the side the magnets are useless.  It needs to be better.I rate this 1 star less because of the charging dongle.  It can definitely be improve on.

Great Dual Screen Option, But LG Misses the Mark Again
","

  This is a really nice phone and I think LG put a lot of thought and care into making this product.  However, LG falls short once again, and I think they could have done better.  The phone is unlocked and I popped in my T-Mobile sim card and had no issues.  I got 4G LTE reception immediately.  No fuss at all.  Yes, it has VoLTE (voice over LTE), wifi calling, and HD voice.  I personally prefer the carrier branded phone, but T-Mobile is NOT carrying this and may never.  This was truly a missed opportunity for them.  Given they passed on the Samsung Fold, they needed an LG flagship for holiday 2019, and a device to stand out from the crowd, but they failed miserably by not carrying this device.  Currently, this is only available on AT&T, Sprint, and unlocked.Now, I like the LG user interface (UI) and wish they would have taken more care in revamping their UI to cater to large screens.  As we all know, phone screens keep getting larger and larger.  This makes one handed use even more challenging.  To solve for this problem, the Samsung One UI semi fixes this problem by shifting all apps and menu options down to the bottom of the screen (not all apps, just some).  This makes it easy for one handed use.  Of course, that is Samsung specific and only on Samsung phones.  However, I think LG should consider doing something similar, and making their own UI even better.One thing that drove me insane is a lot of smartphone makers have their own proprietary text messaging app.  Samsung has it, LG has it, and the iPhone has it.  For some reason, I guess because this is unlocked, LG decided to NOT include their proprietary text messaging app in this phone.  Why? I have no clue.  Their messaging app is great.  It has so many customization options.  One can customize the text message app wallpaper, fonts, size of files received, quality of images received, etc.Given the proprietary Google/Android text messaging app is preinstalled, and can be downloaded from the Google Playstore at any time for FREE, it was a big mistake on LG’s part to omit their own LG app.  Consumers could easily download the Google/Android proprietary one from the store, at any time if they wanted to.  Not sure why anyone would.  If I wanted pure Android, I would have gotten a Google Pixel.  I can’t stand pure Android.  It is the most boring software on the face of this planet.  It is only good when Samsung, LG, and HTC put their own skins on it.Once again, why did LG do this and leave out their own text messaging app? NO CLUE!  It is included on the AT&T and Sprint versions.  So much for giving consumers options.  They didn’t even include their own LG calendar app which is great!  LG, if you are reading this: PLEASE GIVE CONSUMERS OPTIONS.  I don’t know what their mobile division was thinking.  Why would they naturally assume Google makes good, or better apps?  I understand it is Android, but it doesn’t mean everything Google does is PERFECT.  In fact, a lot of Google apps are downright dull, boring, and unintuitive!  Many of their apps haven’t gone through a redesign in years.  I like Samsung, LG, and HTC’s skin overlay on top of the Android UI.  It is what makes them special because Samsung, LG, and HTC offer dual apps.  Aside from that, everything else runs really great and I have some minor complaints.  See my list below:Pros:1. Nice large 6.4 inch AMOLED screen.  Truly beautiful. 1080P only, but that is OK.2. Dual Dolby ATMOS speakers for truly loud sound (About time. No more single speaker)3. 4G LTE (A must in 2019 and any year after 2009)4. Unlocked and super easy to use5. Nice LG UI6. Big 4,000 MAH battery (Should last 2 days)7. 3.5MM headphone jack for wired earphones8. Dual cameras (standard and wide angle lens)9. Dual screen setup10. Special LG browser (whale browser) to utilize dual screen when web browsing11. Wifi Calling and Voice over LTE and HD Voice (for Crystal clear sound)12. Wireless charging13. Fast Charger included14. Quick charge 3.015. Can wirelessly charge with dual screen attached16. In display fingerprint scanner17. Phone can go solo anytime or attach and go dual screen18. Dual screen case is fake leather, but it provides the case with grip so it doesn’t slip19. No notch.  Tear drop front facing camera.20. Hifi QDAC for high quality audio on music files when headphone jack is connected21. Swype keyboard installed (but has to be turned on)Cons:1. No 5G2. Menu system should be updated to make one handed use easier for large screen phones3. 5,000 MAH battery would be good4. Should really be triple camera setup like the LG V40 (standard, wide angle, and telephoto lens)5. LG UI lacks common LG apps like LG messaging and LG calendar (Really LG?)  Had I known, I would have NOT purchased this phone.6. Dual screen can make the phone a tad larger, but it is manageable7. Dual screen case is very square and LG should make rounded edges to take away the appearance of a larger body8. Only certain apps have dual screen use at the moment9. Wish the bend portion was closer together so the screens are closer together10. No T-Mobile jingle ringtone11. No dedicated LG Video player app.  Yes, I can use it via the LG Gallery, but like having both separate.12. Wish it was a QHD display or 4K display, but 1080P is perfectly fine and more than enough13. Dual screen stops once phone battery drops below 15% (Should be used till it goes to 0%)

Not the best use of dual-screen
","

  LG is aiming for the top idea, but missed few points. First of all, the device is great and no regret buying it; but I',m not going to review it. I can't say the same about thr dual-screen case though; and here are few things that, if implemented, would make the best expereince.1- Dual-screen modes: so having dual screens opens up many ideas, but let's stick to what is available. If you attach 02 screens to a PC, you would get options like extended mode (one view on both screens), duplicated mode (similar view in both screens), or single-screen mode (use either of the 02 screens). One would say a PC is different than a smart phone, I would say the same is already applied to the ZTE Axon M. LG, is applying all the modes expet the extended mode. To be honest, it's there but only using chrome and another app they installed.2- The case: the case might be different from a normal case since it has a screen built into it along with the wiring; yet the case is super bulky. The extra bodies on each sided add a lot to the total size. And the hinges are big enough to add a huge space between the 02 screens.The 1st point can be solved with a software update which I hope LG considers very soon. The 2nd one, well, we can live with it.

  What do I like? EVERYTHING. I have never had a phone so up-to-snuff as this eight core Ultra HD screen, camera, and surround speaker BEAST. First, I'm happy with the G8X itself, it is a formidable smart phone to say the least and with Google at its side, anything is possible. This thing is so customizable, the only way to get more out of it is by rooting. But with all the proprietary software made just for the dual screen, it would be a terrible idea and you would miss out on an awesome experience. To me, the game pad alone is worth the money. Developing games myself, I have always wanted a phone like this. The full-sized keyboard, taking up an entire screen, is B-E-A-UTIFUL.All-in-all and in all honesty, five stars across the board.

BEST PHONE FOR THE MONEY

  This is an amazing phone! It surpassed all of my expectations. The cameras are exceptional quality!! Speakers are good! Plenty of memory room. Very easy to set up and use. I purchased this phone and went to my carrier, Metro By TMobile, and paid $33.00 for a new sim card. Everyone at the Metro store was blown away! None of the employees or customers had seen this phone yet. Everyone fell in love with it just as I have!! I highly recommend you give this phone a try!! P.S. I had to purchased a new sim card as I had an LG G Stylo phone that was 7 yrs old and the sim card in my old phone was a diffetent size and would not fit in this phone. Small price to pay for such an amazing quality phone! The dual screens are to die for!!!

What a sleeper of a phone!!!

  Hats off to LG for this phone, it's a shame this will never get the attention it deserves. I read some articles saying the phone by itself is boring, well I would have to disagree! The screen is beautiful, it has a headphone jack with a great DAC and is IP68 water-resistant and has no camera bump on the back, I have never been a fan of the notch on the front but have learned to live with them.  The addition of the 2nd screen case is a bold move and a really great thing to have. For work, I am constantly looking at floorplans or other files while emailing a response to clients so having this other screen is a dream, it's not the sexiest design for the case but it's a great start at where this concept can go. The small UI tweaks they have done to Android I also appreicate, like the way it handles blue tooth connected devices.  For the price and what you get this phone is hard to beat, I went from a One Plus 6T to this and so happy I took the dive.

Awesome phone

  If you're looking for value for your money? Look no further. It's like having a little laptop, and makes task switching so much easier. Not only is this phone water resistant, includes a - wait for it - headphone jack, and a 32 mp camera and also a wide view camera, huge battery, and a mind blowing array of interesting features, but the included case has a dedicated 2nd screen.This means - enter data on one screen while looking it up on the other. Turn the bottom half into a keyboard and the top screen into a display (still working on this one). We'll see how long it lasts, but it seems very sturdy so far. My old Samsung Galaxy S6 is still going strong after a good 5 years of use.So the pros far outnumber the cons but there are a few things that may be annoying that should be addressed:You will want to get a screen protector for the 2nd screen, since when using the phone as a -phone- you need to fold the 2nd screen to the rear, exposing it.There are limited apps designed for dual screens. Hopefully this will get better in the future. If you're thinking about using this for gaming utilizing the 2nd screen, make sure to verify that any games you buy are designed for it.The phone snaps into the case which includes the 2nd screen, but the case requires an (included) dongle with a USB-C connector on one end and a magnet on the other. This means that if you forget your charging cable & dongle, you can't just plug the phone into any old charger. Not without taking it out of the case. And if you lose the dongle you'll have to take it out of the case every time you want to charge it. Just something to think about, but I don't think I'll lose the dongle. Plus they're available on Amazon for $30 if I do.And I really can't think of any other cons right now.

So underrated!!!

  Of all the phones out for 2019, this definitely goes above and beyond pretty much all of them. Having used the phone now for a couple week, I am glad to report that most of the cons that have been reviewed of this phone are mostly exaggerated. My biggest worries when buying this were the screen would be too dim and the battery would drain too quick. The dimmness issue reported by some website reviews are conpletely false and screen brightness in the sun is not an issue. As for battery life, LG has done an outstanding job optimizing for two screens. Yes, the battery drains slightly faster with two screens (as expected), but when the second screen isnt in use, battery life is exceptionally good.Really my only nitpick of the phone is the dual screen case. I wish the edges of the case protected the phone a bit better, but you can mitigate this with a screen protector. The only other con has been that this phone is not advertised nearly as much as it should be!

As someone who listens to music on a phone everyday at work, I really appreciate LG keeeping the headphone jack. There are multiple sound customizations available and the sound is superb.  Fingerprint reader can be a bit wonky.  Battery lasts me all day with juice to spare.  At any rate, $650 is a great price for this phone.

  The Redmi Note 9 Pro was a decent phone in other respects (before I had to return it), but save your time trying to enable Wifi calling--the option is absent from the settings, where you'd find it on other Android phones.  I found a roundabout way to check that VoWifi was enabled, but apparently this is different from T-Mobile's Wifi Calling (at least in the U.S.?). The T-Mobile tech staff was unable to help. I've read that this phone's VoWifi works with some international carriers--Jio and AirTel.

   I'd like to preface that I owned a phone repair shop for over 5 years. I've never seen a phone with quality control so lacking...1. My phone arrived, brand new, with a scratch already on the screen. A little hard to see in the picture, not too wide, but it is DEEP.2. SIM card tray will not go in smoothly, gets caught on something inside, and 4/5 times the Sim will not be read. It also sticks up about a millimeter past where it should. See video.3. Interstellar gray? Pshhh. More like swamp blue/green. What is this color? Very unprofessional color to take to meetings and meet clients, etc. They should change the color name.Maybe it's a good phone, but I won't know because I'm not trusting another one, personally. I'm morally tired of misleading color names and poor quality control from lesser known brands. I think I'll just stick to the tried and true for now.

  The phone is a very good value for the money and punches well above its price point, but in some ways, you get what you pay for.The good: Great battery life, large screen, good cameras, smooth UI, very quick.The bad: The screen could be better, it's slightly dark and the colors don't quite pop like on true flagship phones. By far the biggest issue though is the frequent wifi outages. Sometimes wifi shows connected, sometimes disconnected, but I can expect wifi to stop working every 30 minutes or so. It happens across all wifi networks, factory reset didn't fix it, updated miui didn't fix it either. If you don't have unlimited data, beware.

Even for more now they have removed the option to adjust vibration intensity  like soft , medium to hi tapping on the screen. So there is no way to adjust haptic feedback strength.

Just don't do it.

  Leason learned with this one.  I received the phone a couple weeks ago, but waited for my daughter to get home from college for Christmas before activating it.  After she activated it, she was having problems sending messages, etc., so she went to the Verizon store for help.  She was told the serial number for the phone is blacklisted because it has been reported lost or stolen.  When we tried to re-active her old phone, her number had been blocked for fraud associated with the stolen/lost phone.  She and my husband were on the phone with Verizon last night for more than two hours trying to get this mess resolved.  Don't do it.  It's not worth it.  Just get a new phone.

Faulty product, non-existent customer service

  The camera doesn’t work, neither does the flash light. This has been a problem since unpacking the item. Eventually, both would work after resetting and restoring my iPhone but would then stop after a few days.I have dealt with this issue for over a month. Initially, I tried calling the seller multiple times and have left a voice message. Never heard from them. So I am now stuck with a faulty phone that works on its own terms.The seller was Lonestar Mobile.

DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!

  I bought this phone and it immediately started having problems and I try to contact the company but no response, I contacted amazon and one person told me i can mail it back for my money back,  i then talked to someone else who said the first person was wrong and that if i were to have sent my phone back (I Was waiting a day because I wanted to buy a new phone so i would have one) I would of not received any money and would be out a phone and money. I contacted the company again and they replied but are refusing at the very least a return, suggesting I take it to a ""repair shop"" and have them look at it. It freezes constantly and the volume doesn't work most of the time and at random times every day it makes a loud beeping sound and goes black for about a minute. I'm very disappointed in the whole situation.

I should've expected what I got
","

  I ordered 2 phones, and should have expected the worst since what I got wasn't all that. One phone has a bunch of mini screen scratches, a few deeper ones, and an extremely deep one that was unavoidable (photos attached just of this one phone). Along with that, the phone came with a few dents and scratches around the edges anyway (which was ok and what I expected). The other phone I got had very very very few screen scratches and the minimal amount of expected dents on the side. On top of that, the way the home buttons felt when you pressed them felt different between the two of them. Both phones turned on fine, sound worked and touch screens worked normal. However I didn't even bother setting them up since I was going to return them.Since this item is $150 less than a new iPhone 8, doesn't come with Apple charger or headphones, the price difference wasn't worth it in my opinion and I ended up returning both of the phones. I'm leaving two stars since one of the phones was in decent shape and since I expected to possibly return these phones anyway. Just expect the worst but low-key hope for the best because in my case with was pretty much night and day between the two phones.

Phone looked great, but was defective
","

  Phone arrived on time, and looked completely new.  Was easy to set up and worked exactly as expected.  After two weeks, if I was out and was carrying the phone in a bag it would begin to randomly execute functions.  Initially I thought I had been hacked, but I read on line that this probably means the screen installation is faulty.  Unfortunately this happened  while I was on vacation, so I ended up being without a cell phone during my trip whenever I was out of the house.  It also deleted all my music (which I was able to re load when I returned home).  It then took another week to call and obtain the postage paid label and buy a replacement phone once I returned home, so I was without a mobile phone for several weeks.  I have bought refurbished phones in the past without any problem.  I intend to try again to buy a refurbished phone as it is the phone I want, it did look perfect, the battery life seems good, and the price is very good.

SHUTTER SOUND WOULDN'T MUTE!
","

  The phone was beautiful and perfect in great condition! However, the shutter sound would not mute, which meant it was probably from Japan where it is illegal to mute the camera shutter sound. You can't even turn it down. There was NOTHING I could do to mute the sound. I tried everything, even running it on another app. I returned the phone...I was sad because it was perfect. If you don't mind the sound, you should but it...be beware!

Free screen protector hid screen condition.
","

  I received the iPhone 8 with a new/free screen protector installed. This was nice but unexpected. Upon closer examination I saw what appeared to be a small crack or deep scratch on the screen so I removed the screen protector and verified there was a small crack along with multiple scratches. The lightening connector port was also dirty and had scratches. Ultimately, I did not feel it met the standard of being renewed and not worth the money spent.  I am in the process of returning the iPhone 8 and will find another vendor.

Buyer beware - shutter sound can’t be turned off!
","

  Everything about this product has been perfect. The quality was indistinguishable from new, it has functioned reliably and perfectly since I received it. This would have been an easy 5-star review except for one thing:This is a refurb unit from Japan, which means that the camera shutter sound is hardwired in and cannot be muted, turned down, or turned off.That one little thing is enough to make this unit borderline unusable for me, as I primarily (used to!) use my phone camera for wildlife photography on hikes. Now a single exceptionally loud click sends every critter in the vicinity scurrying for cover.

COMPANY LIED IN THEIR ADVERTISING - PHONE WAS NOT FOR VERIZON AS ADVERTISED!!
","

  (I bought this for my son to be placed on my current VERIZON network plan) ...so..ok, let me start by saying that i received the phone via 2-day Prime shipping. Phone came in a generic box, but sufficient for transport. It included the charger and 3ft charging cable. nothing else. Unboxed, the phone was in EXCELLENT cosmetic condition, not a single scratch anywhere. I powered it on, the display was beautiful and worked as it should. At that point I ran thru the setup and got the phone all setup for my son (its his b-day present) ... then I took the phone to VERIZON STORE and had them put a VERIZON SIM in it for activation and to be added to my current verizon plan ....WELL GUESS WHAT... this phone is a model A1905, and it is ONLY GSM carrier compatible, NOT CDMA, which is what verizon is.... but yet, this phone was advertised as "" FOR VERIZON"" , which is the ONLY reason I went ahead and bought it. The Verizon models are A1863 & A1864. So I have given the review 2 stars because of the great cosmetic, great camera and fully functional condition , but because they LIED, and DID NOT send me what I purchased (a phone for VERIZON networks), I do feel that this is unacceptable that tey are allowed to Advertise one thing, then send you another. Where I come from we call that a big fat LIE!!! and I DO NOT put up with LIARS, therefore I  reporting themfor FALSE ADVERTISEMENT and hopefully they will be kicked off of AMAZON

Careful of the IMEI
","

  A word to the wise, have BREED check the IMEI of what they're sending you. IMEI's are specific to GSM or CDMA, and even if the phone is fully unlocked, if the IMEI doesn't match, it won't work. For example, Verizon and Sprint have compatible IMEI's, and AT&T and T Mobile are compatible.I got a phone, and the IMEI did not work with my network, which is how I learned about all of this.A word on BREED, though. They are very easy to talk to, and very helpful. I doubt you will have any trouble reaching someone who can help you get the right phone for your network. I returned my phone with no problems, and they were very understanding about the difficulty.

Beware of refurbished iPhones - Disappointed
","

  The good:1. The phone was delivered in a timely fashion just before Christmas.2. It looked perfect, no physical defects.The bad & the ugly:1. I discovered the phone came from Japan where the camera sound cannot be turned off, by law. Took it to the Apple Store, and said they couldn't do anything about it. I take a lot of photos, and the loud click is a pain. But, that was a minor detail for the price.2. Most importantly, the phone locked up suddenly. The Apple Store couldn't unlock it. The only way was to wipe it clean to factory settings. Lost everything that wasn't stored in the cloud, including my photos. The phone has a 256 GB memory. Didn't want to bother with paying extra storage space in the cloud. Let's hope this doesn't happen again... Or else, monthly payments on a NEW phone may no longer look as optional... :(

  Everything was fine until the screen started glitching not even a month in. Now the bottom of the screen mirrors the top.

Japanese market iPhones received, can't disable camera shutter sound
","

  I ordered 2 iPhone 8's from this vendor at a good price.The phones I received work well, but after using them a while we discovered that we were unable to disable the rather loud camera shutter sound.  This is apparently a ""feature"" of Japanese market iPhones due to local laws.  Sure enough, when we find the Model code in the settings, these are Japanese models, even though we are in the U.S.There was no indication that we would receive foreign model phones in the listing, nor how they may differ from US distributed phones.  The listing indicates that the phones are ""For AT&T"", which I believe is a U.S. only network provider.This is somewhat annoying.

Camera sound will ALWAYS be on

  Overall, this phone is great, just as advertised! I use StraightTalk and this phone was easy to switch over. One thing I absolutely HATE and is causing me to return the phone is the shutter sound on the camera. Everything else was as expected, but as in other reviews I see this phone might have originated from a place where the shutter sound is mandatory (see other similar reviews). I am super not a fan of this! It happens on places where the camera is used as well, like Snapchat. Made it really weird when I was taking pictures of my notes in the library. I've tried everything to get it to turn off, but I will be returning this phone and purchasing it directly through my carrier (which is what I was trying to avoid by making this purchase). Would've been PERFECT except this one feature.

NO SIM Card

  Shipping was fast but the phone was scratched, sometimes it wont shift between camera settings, and there was NO SIM card! I was very frustrated.I lost my iPhone 11 so the iPhone 8  is my back up. The camera quality feels so poor compared to what I’m used to but that has nothing to do with the seller.I just really wish I would’ve been more aware that the seller did not include a SIM card with purchase of the phone.I live six hours round-trip from a Verizon store so they had to ship me the SIM card before I could even activate the phone. That took another 5 days.

Mostly a Great Deal
","

  The overall physical condition of my “refurbished” iPhone 8 is excellent!  I can’t find a scratch on the device.  The transfer of SIM cards to this phone was easy and fast, since the phone was unlocked already.  My only complaint is that the battery health of the device is at 87%.  When you get below 90 you start to notice, and in this case, it’s easy to do that.  The phone drops a full 100% charge rather quickly.  The price was low enough, that investing in a new battery is worth it.  That’s my only complaint.  All and all this was a good deal and a good quality iPhone 8.

  This is my third week with this phone. Its perfect but there’s a tiny few problems. First of all what I hate with a passion is the camera shutter sound which I tried everything I possibly could to turn it off but nothing at all worked. Then after some researched I learnt that all iphones from Japan are like this because it’s illegal to take photos in public on silent. Last thing is the battery life. It came with 97% capacity which is amazing but it goes kinda fast like my old phone but after watching some YouTube videos I think its just how iPhone 8s are because of all these running apps and stuff so I did turn siri and some few things off and it surprisingly improved my battery health a lot. So I don’t know if that’s how the iPhone 8s are. And also if you wanna buy this get the red one its beautifullllll😍. Mine came a with 0 scratches very neat with the charger( not original but its still very good) all nicely in a white box and you can buy this with confidence because you know there’s a 30 day or i think three months free return. And also I wanted to use this with simple mobile but it didn’t work so I currently use h2o wireless which is bum a**. Hope this review helped its 💯 percent honest.Edit- you can fix the camera sound by downloading apps such as Microsoft Pix which allows you to turn off camera shutter sounds, other than that you’ll have to jailbreak your phone.

  For those of you trying to suss out which seller is best through the aggregated reviews, I ordered my from Electro Wireless. The phone took about a week to ship out, but to be fair I ordered just before the Fourth of July and I can see how that would gum up the works. It arrived within a day of being shipped though, so that made up for it.The phone looks immaculate (no scratches or dents). So far I've had no issues (though it's only been 24 hours). I booted it up, put in my sim, placed calls, sent texts, changed display settings, tested the speakers with my music, etc....anything I could really think to test I did. The phone came with the tool to open the sim tray, a USB plug, and charge cable (the plug and cable are not Apple products, which I expected, but since some reviews act surprised, I'll confirm for those of you who think that really matters).There are two minor downsides. The battery capacity is only at 89% right now. While that's still entirely useable, at 80% the battery is essentially dead/needs replaced. So I've only got 9% to use, though I'm not sure how long that will take me to run down so maybe that doesn't matter. The second downside is they also send a tempered glass screen protector, BUT, it's unfortunately the wrong size. Not sure if it's for the 8S or a newer iPhone, but it sure isn't for the regular old 8. I ordered a case anyway, so it's not really an issue for me.

  This was a beautiful phone and a very good price. Everything worked great on it, except, unfortunately, the sound. I could hear everything just fine, but people I called said I sounded like I had my head in a bucket. I ended up returning it, so it might seem strange that I am reviewing it, but just wanted to let buyers know that the 90 day return makes it easy to take a chance on a renewed phone. No questions asked, no tricky stipulations. Just make sure you keep all your original materials and stay within the 90 days. The next phone I bought seems to be perfect, other than it isn’t that cheerful red. I did subtract one star because I think it could have been more thoroughly checked out prior to sale.

As advertised, except for the model number!
","

  I specifically sought this US-based model number A1863: it is listed as such.  Awesome.  I instead received a Japanese version model A1902 (apple p/n MQ782J/A).  Did you know that the Japanese model doesn't allow the user to silence the shutter sound effect when taking pictures, or the beeps when starting or stopping video recording?  After some embarrassment in front of clients at job site surveys, I researched the model number and learned why it was happening.  I ended up downloading a non-Apple camera app, in order to avoid the sound effects.  If I was sent the A1863 model as listed, this issue would not have cropped up.  That is why I am taking off one star from this review.To the seller's credit, the phone arrived a day early, was packaged well, and was in excellent physical shape.  All I had to do was put my SIM card in it, and load in everything from my iTunes account.  I've had it for several weeks, with no hiccups.AppleCare coverage was obviously expired and the battery reported its maximum health as 88%, but this is obviously a used phone.  Still a good value for me.

I was able to insert my AT&T SIM card and have it work immediately without any complications, I was able to call/text people within minutes of activating the phone. I’ve only had this phone for a week now and so far nothing seems to raise any red flags yet, I’ll update my review if anything changes.

A great phone from a great seller!
","

  I researched the iPhone 6,7, and 8 as replacements for my aging 5s. I also sought out sellers with good ratings for this purchase. I settled on MyWit based on their reviews and their volume of sales. The phone arrived a day early and it is absolutely pristine. If it is a refurb, there are zero signs of that as there are no marks anywhere on it. Not even finger prints or dust. It came with a nice flex lighting cable and Apple charger (no sim as advertised).I put the sim card from my old iPhone 5s in it and went through the setup questions. I had a fully functional iPhone 8  in 5 minutes tops.  I selected the iPhone 8 over the 6 or 7 due to the advanced technology in the 8. It is worth the extra $100 over the same size 7.  It is fast but the battery lasts all day without showing significant signs of needing a charge.I also purchased a Speck Candy Shell case for this phone. The iPhone 8 has a glass back for wireless charging and it is very smooth and slick to hold. With my dry fingers, it is difficult to even use the phone so a case is necessary to give it some grip. The Speck case is a perfect, anti-slip and lots of drop and screen protection. See this case here https://www.amazon.com/Speck-Products-CandyShell-Phone-iPhone/dp/B01K094IZ8Very pleased with the seller too and I would certainly use them for another phone purchase without question!

","

  Unbelievable. Received the phone in the same conditions as described in other reviews. Folded, with no film on inside screen and crooked film on outside screen. The screen shows very distinct marks from foldings. But besides packaging issues, the primary reason that convinced me to return the device, that I haven't so far read in other reviews, is that the screen squeaks when opening and closing. It seems that the cheaper US price may be justified by a batch with subpar level of quality. I cannot believe the Motorola guys are setting themselves up for failure again after the poor device they launched last year. Very disappointed given all the anticipation and purchase on day of launch. One star is being generous for such an expensive device.

Used phone. No WiFi calling
","

  This phone supposed to be new. Unfortunately same like others no film on the screen and folded in the box. Also to all buying to use with Verizon, there is no WiFi calling option (few hours with tier 2 tech from Verizon and effect was “your phone is broken”). So no WiFi calling and no advance calling (HD sound). Very disappointing as I really like the size of the phone and nostalgic effect.

  my shipment was delayed. I started to notice this happen only when i purchase stuffs that are more expensive and usually electronic. Either way i got it one day later than usual which is fine and not end of the world, but the device i recieved definitely is not brand new. Also they didn't provide any kind of protection in the box. It was literary just the phone box inside an amazon. Little concerningIt seem someone already unpackage the device as there is extra tape sticker on the side covering the original, and the film with the razer logo on the front screen is not even align properly. I mean we talking it was not even covering the screen at all and just covering the camera, and almost falling off(for people that are saying its totally fine. Sure if I'm buying a used phone and not one that cost $1249. Weird marking around the device and inside of the device which is usual for something that is mark as brand new. Going to contact support and see If i can exchange it.

Does not stay in place
","

  It's a new phone so it is hard to find a nice protective slim case, I thought this was it but unfortunately, the case does not stay in place. If you see my picture, the top is supposed to have a clip on each side of the case but is missing the right side. The bottom of the case stays put but the top pops off to the smallest touch. The case arrives in a simple plastic bag but it actually looks really nice on. It does have the leathery feel on top but it does not fit the moto rzr 5g right.

Folding Touchscreen problem
","

  I am extremely disappointed with the Razr 5G touch screen. ( I was so excited to have the Motorola Razr5G 2020)Just after the use of one month, the touch screen becomes not responding to the touch and it came off in the fold section with discolouration in the screen. The phone was unable to use at all which forced me to go back to my old phone (Luckily I didn't discard or reset my old phone).Another issue which I noticed in the Razr 5G was the signal reception - both for Wifi as well as mobile signal, it was pretty less when compared with my old Samsung S8 (I used both the mobiles side by side and I can confirm)

Amazon refused to offer me a replacement since I bought it on a black Friday deal and now it 200 USD more , so they only agreed to a full refund so i have to pay 200 usd more that what i originally payed to get a properly functioning unit ....Very disappointed

Not worth the money.

  Edit11/12/2020:I've had to drop this thing to one star. Ever since owning this, the 5ghz wifi is bad. Android Auto loses connectivity constantly unless you use Motorola's solution - a 6"" cable. Yep 6 inches. While at first there seemed to be an interest in finding a solution through Motorola, our pleas have been basically abandoned. No issues like this on my Note 9. I am saddened as the phone is nice, but an old version of Android, failing Android auto, and terrible wifi plagues this for it's price.End EditI badly want to make this 5 stars but there's just a few things with it where it doesn't pull through. That being said, I actually would not have chosen a different phone if I could have.Pros:-The flip! It sounds stupid, but there's something about the screen and the flip of it. It decreases it's size wonderfully and it's nice having that form factor.-Build quality. This thing, the design is fantastic. Engineering is wonderful. There is no slop whatsoever and I love that. They cared about this device-5g support. Not much to say there.-Camera. Quad pixel is awesome. In the end the photo is 12mp, but it uses 48 to create that. Results are fantastic.-No bloat! This has a legitimately clean Google OS with no bloat, it's awesome.-Comes with usb-c to 3.5mm headphone jack.Cons:-Price tag. For a smaller battery, not top of the line hardware, it has a top of the line price.-Wifi card in it is definitely crappier than my note 9. Cellular is fine.-OS. It is released with Android 10 and still on it-No wireless charging. For a phone this pricey, wouldn't have taken much.Things to note:-The folding screen does leave some feelable creases in the screen. You can't really see it when the screen is on though. Might REALLY bother some people. Doesn't bother me at all.-They probably could have decreases the price by $100 by just shipping it in a normal box. That being said, it was a fun unboxing.

  This review has 3 parts.  Part 1: The phone itself is not practical. It is hard to hold and even harder to open. You need both hands to open. The screen is a film. It is back to 15 years ago when phone screens were made of film. Not waterproof. The phone specs are far below other smartphones on the market.Part 2: This seller is giving you used phones. The package is already open. You can see fingerprints on the phone and screen. The screen has bumps underneath. These phones are either used or defective sold as new.Part 3:  Amazon tells you they will refund you within 7 days of receipt. Took them more than 3 weeks to refund.  I had to contact them 2 times to get my money back.Bottom line: Stay away from this product sold on Amazon.

  Game of Phones | Motorola RAZR 2020• Too expensive• Too cumbersome• Speakerphone - Echoes• Bluetooth – Yes and Maybe• Battery life - Subpar• Snapdragon - Not too snappy• Camera - Blows• Flip open - Cheese Squeezer• Text to speech - Awesome• Form factor rating - 5 stars• Functional rating – MehNutshell Disclosure – Submitted by the CEO of WEBPRO.COM.

WEBPRO was designing and developing mobile APPS when the industry was calling devices PDAs.I’m not a Youtuber or a Vlogger but like you, I am a consumer and believe in getting my money’s worth. With that said, we look to tech-heads like Patrick Holland over at CNET for an honest review in hopes of making an informed purchase. Let’s face it, all Patrick has to do is smile in Motorola’s direction and he gets one. When I worked as an engineer at Microsoft many years ago, I got to play with a lot of toys but that was decades ago. I also like MrMobile [Michael Fisher] and was sorry to see him drop and shatter his brand new RAZR 2020 in early December. Unlike Patrick, he bought his out of pocket like me and unfortunately didn’t purchase the insurance. I subscribe to both their channels.In all fairness, I wanted the 2020 MOTO FLIP RARZ and couldn’t wait to get mine despite Patrick Holland’s gushing over all the phone’s bristling capabilities including his disclosing the cha-ching part. Patrick has that personal flair that makes you instantly subscribe to that rascal’s channel but unless you actually buy the RAZR, you’ll notice several irritating aspects, starting with one of my favorite features; the SPEAKER. That’s where the echo comes in. You don’t notice it until the person you’re speaking with tells you, your phone sucks! The quick remedy is taking them off speaker-phone by tapping the speaker icon then transferring to one of several Bluetooth devices provided they are available or nearby.ToothlessBells and whistles are fun if you're willing to shell out but let's be a little practical.  After all, you’re investing a lot of money into a phone, not a throne. And if Bluetooth loses its bite from your vehicle while driving, the RAZR's technology ceases thus posing a safety liability and that's not a game!No phone is worth getting killed over.I was always a huge MOTO fan but the RAZR may be going back. In its place, I’m considering the Motorola Edge Plus - with insurance MrMobile. The 2020 RAZR was supposed to be a long-awaited upgrade from my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 which I couldn’t wait to get rid of, for two reasons. I hated Bixby, the preloaded bloatware and the text to speech was the absolute worst. That’s where Motorola excels but the Samsung camera was superb! So good, in fact, it would rival a Nikon Coolpix 500 but I digress.MOTO RAZR 2020 OBSERVATIONYou would think, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor would address generic phone functionalities but the focus for using that processor may have been intended for games, camera, and flipping between apps.  I wouldn't grant my RAZR too much latitude to be described as ""smoothly"" as Motorola does but I'm not being paid to write this review nor did anyone flip me a phone for free.Not only do I have to box everything up and send it all back, but I'm also still waiting for the Amazon delivery van to run over my grass to deliver more accessories at the time of this post. This is like paying for an engagement ring years after a breakup. Amazon is going to have a cow on all these returns but hey, you can't beat Amazon's return policy but I'll never get roped into another ""carrier"" agreement again with you know who.ADVICEBuy your phone outright and UNLOCKED and make sure Amazon will honor a 30 return. A 14-day return policy with a 20% restocking fee is no deal from your carrier. Oh! Buy insurance for anything over 500.00CONCLUSIONThe RAZR failed on light duty activity. All that techno and no wireless charging. That's two raspberries but not a deal-breaker. The deal-breaker is practicality, overall experience, and safety. Having to hang up and call a client back because of a horrible echo is annoying and inconvenient but dropping my Bluetooth connection whenever it feels like from a new Motorola Escape 800 ANC Wireless Headphones, a Motorola Verve Buds 500, or my Pioneer satellite Bluetooth radio is a non-starter!Pictures were supplied by my Samsung Galaxy Note 8Folks’ at the end of the day, it’s a phone! Maybe Motorola will get it right next year. Meanwhile, I still have my StarTAC Dual-band analog if they screw it up. I’ll let you know how the Edge Plus goes.Kirk out!

  I've got my RAZR 5G yesterday and activated eSim already. However when I put in the other physical SIM card, I found that RAZR does NOT allow dual SIM to work at the same time.

I really wanted to keep this phone
","

  Phone arrived already opened, with the screen protector removed and phone folded up with a hacked up piece of foam inserted, which left foam chunks and dust everywhere, into the top of the box to hold the phone in place during shipping. I appreciate the idea but the execution was poor. Not fun to open a product in this price range and it seem to be used and handled poorly before I could open it myself.The phone itself is very neat, ran great, almost well made, a couple of issues made me return it, the main one being the screen itself.The hinge is solid but it creates a permanent curve in the middle of the phone that distorts the image as you scrolled through content. I thought at first I would get used to it, but I never did. Then, 2 separate indention lines from underlying supports of the hinge bulges though the screen, which appeared halfway between the hinge curve and top/bottom of the phone adding 2 indentions to the hinge area. This was not visible from review videos, each one I saw during unboxing looked smooth from side reflecting views. These indentions plus the curve of the hinge in the middle made the entire feel of the screen ripply like a potato chip.After a week of light use, the secondary indentions started to have a wrinkle like distortion on the screen like pulling plastic wrap too tight around a casserole dish. After just one week of light use, I'd hate to see how worse the screen gets over time. For $1500, I didn't want to risk seeing how bad it could get.Finally, the speaker phone gave off static during calls, which I use a good bit during regular calls to the family, at home, not in public :) No other phone that I've owned has ever done that. I tried multiple calls, to different phones, carriers and it was consistent, dunno if it was my phone specifically or just the type of speaker used.Again I really wanted to like this phone as i owned the black version of the original but for this price I couldn't overlook these issues and didn't want to see the quality diminish making the screen unusable.

No Sure
","

  I have purchased the last Motorola Razr 2019 (4G) back in February and it broke down way too many times (it was the hinge that was at fault causing the outside screen not to work and the inside screen not to lock when folded).  The warranty was excellent because they replaced it both times with a new phone as the service agent were not able to fix it.  The second time I received a new replacement, I was too afraid to proceed with the phone.  So I sold it at less than half than what I paid for it and bought the Razr 5G 2020 thinking surely it was improved.  It took two months for Razr 5G to breakdown but this time it had to do with the microphone not working (so people cannot hear me when I made or received calls).  In addition, the charger can only charge slowly.  Today, it is once again at the service agent's workshop [long sigh].  The good thing is that they all know me by name now at the service shop.You can imagine all my friends with iPhones and Samsungs.  They laughed when I decided to breakaway from the pack and buy the Razr 4G.  I made the mistake again by purchasing the Razr 5G to only be disappointed once again!!

  Same as others. Delicately opened the package and there was a piece of plastic wrap on the top (for no reason that I could see) but had like oil dripping down the side from the plastic.

Beautiful Form Factor & UI / UX .. Horrible WiFi!!!

  The good!Phone form factor is great! By far best foldable experience you will find. Software is smooth.Here's the bad!1. Wifi absolutely positively sucks! It just doesn't produce a stable connection. You can be 1 ft from the router and still it won't maintain full bars. I have wifi 6 routers with 3 access points on ethernet backhaul. No other device in my house has any issues connecting to the wifi. There is something seriously wrong here.2. Phone doesn't present 5G connection option although I am on a 5G network /service outside of US (travel alot) or any network provider not in default list. (no idea why!) The bands listed on device specs are the 5G bands the networks were on.Bottomline I will keep it, BUT the moment the new version comes out with an improved wifi chip / performance I will trade this in. If not for this I would keep it for 3-4 yrs like I normally do.

Supremely pocketable, with lots of other tradeoffs.

  From the original MicroTAC, I've had a thing for Motorola flip phones. I upgraded from the MicroTAC to the StarTAC, the original RAZR, a KRZR... it wasn't until the iPhone that I abandoned poor Motorola. So, seeing an Android resurrection that not only looked like a RAZR but also had 5G was something I couldn't pass up. Especially after parting with my Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, because I was sick of needing to adjust my pocket every time I got in to my car.After a few days in though, I might have to pass it up.The phone itself is beautiful, though my wife noticed it charging and asked what I was doing with a new Blackberry. Indignant, I told her it was a RAZR, and she laughed. Be cautious if you think you're making a fashion statement with this phone.I was apparently blessed with a phone that doesn't creak. The only noise you hear when opening or shutting it is the ""clap"" when the phone shuts. I had forgotten how much I missed hanging up by closing the phone.The internal display has surprisingly vivid color reproduction, and you don't really notice the curve or underlying bumps after a few seconds. However, you definitely notice the tactile differences when using the screen, and I found that some areas of the screen need a slightly forceful push where most glass screen phones are tappable. You're not going to mistake the screen for the 120Hz 4K OLED / AMOLED planks on flagship phones, but unless you're the type to constantly scroll back and forth through your apps to behold the majesty of your refresh rate, you probably won't feel like you're missing out.On the other hand, the narrow display does feel like a bit of a throwback. I've grown used to setting Chrome and Edge to request desktop versions of sites, and found things like news sites to be unreadable without constantly zooming in and out. When I changed the setting to fetch mobile sites by default, the RAZR 2020 felt a lot like the RAZR V3 pulling WAP sites from the long, long ago.The camera is... well, you get a camera. It isn't potato-cam bad. It's good enough that Surface Duo owners would be rightfully jealous. It's fine for simple snapshots that you're never going to crop and enlarge. I could get by with it, and if I had to choose between Samsung's beautify filters that can't be turned off and a comparatively low-res RAZR photo that looks normal (if a bit grainy), I'd probably go the RAZR route. But if I was looking for something as a content creator or had any photographer inclinations, I'd be sad with what the RAZR's camera is capable of.A bright spot is the 5G connectivity. I'm on AT&T, and they've chosen to whitelist devices for 5G access. Fortunately, that includes the RAZR. I'm not sure if it's materials or antenna placement, but the RAZR pulls a much stronger 5G signal with higher bandwidth than my Note 20 Ultra or S20+. And because 5G isn't fully built out in the places I usually go, I definitely appreciated how the RAZR will give up on a bad 5G connection and flip to 4G where the Samsung phones will cling on to 5G for dear life -- so much so that I regularly use an app on the Samsung phones to disable 5G (for anyone not on AT&T, the built-in function for this is disabled on unlocked Samsung phones when you use an AT&T SIM).But for as good as that 5G/4G management is, Motorola (er... Lenovo, since it's really Lenovo now?) chose not to bake that intelligence into the wi-fi management. Most devices I have will happily find and use whatever the strongest signal is, but the RAZR doesn't want to let go of a wi-fi network until it disappears from rangeNow... let's talk about the processor. I really went back and forth on the RAZR because it's a very expensive phone for something packing a Snapdragon 765G. Even when Amazon discounts the phone by hundreds of dollars (as they have at the time of this writing), I'm not sure you can find a phone teetering on the edge of four figures that doesn't have an 865 or 865+ SoC. And while Google has managed to squeeze every single drop of performance they can out of the 765G in the Pixel 5, the RAZR still feels pokey even when compared to the Pixel 3 and the 845 SoC it contains.I don't know if that's because Android 11 makes better use of the 765G, or if it's just good old Google magic that makes the Pixel 5 seem mostly as good as a current-gen phone, but even three year-old games like Sonic Forces: Speed Battle choke the RAZR. Even with all other apps killed and Gaming Mode enabled. Not a gamer? Okay, Outlook absolutely chokes if you have multiple large inboxes. I don't really consider myself a ""power user"" compared to people who are making and editing 4K videos on their devices in between CoD matches, and I'm telling you for basic games and heavy-ish business use, the RAZR feels underpowered relative to midrange phones from two or three years ago.On a similar tangent, I'm a little concerned about getting updates from Motorola. We're coming into the middle of November, and my RAZR is happily plugging along on the August 2020 security patch. No updates came out of the box. No updates have been offered when I've done manual checks. No updates on wi-fi, no updates when plugged in. No updates after rebooting, changing the calendar, or slowly chanting ""Hello, Moto..."" Even stranger, the carrier-branded versions seem to have updates as recently as October.Not surprisingly, battery life on the RAZR isn't awesome, either. The first day I got it, I wasn't very surprised that it wanted to be charged after about 6 - 7 hours. I'd been installing everything, doing lots of stuff with the internal display, and testing everything I could. But even on days when I'm just checking mail and making a few calls, getting a full day out of the RAZR is about the best I can do. If I was going on a road trip or had an emergency pop up at like 10:00 p.m., I'd be pretty nervous if I didn't have a car charger or power bank at the ready. You expect that with a phone this size, but that kind of battery life was what prompted me to replace my Pixel 3 XL after two years of heavy use had diminished the battery life.Would I recommend this? Probably not to most people -- especially anyone who does more than simple phone calls and texting. Yes, the pocketability is a straight up joy that I've missed for a very long time. Yes, the external display works really well for banging out quick messages and checking your texts and notifications. But once you ask the RAZR for more, it just can't deliver.

Razr: Not better than your phone, just swankier.
","

  So just like the reviewer before me, when I opened the box the clamshell was closed and the sticker was lazly hanging on to the outer screen. 'Rushed' would be the word I would use to describe how it looked if speaking to a blind man. But no scratches, dents or fingerprints. According to the Motorola unboxing the Razr is upright and presented nicely, not hastily thrown in a box and shipped.As for the phone itself: Awesome. I am so far happy with my purchase. I preferred this color over the the blush and mercury (att only) because those colors look 2 tone. Meaning, top half (second screen) is different color than the body. This graphite color blends in nicely with it's black top half.Call quality has been great so far. At the other end they told me they could hear a definite difference (galaxy s9). I also got to do a video conference, smooth baby smooth. Thankfully I did not misplace the usb to 3.5 jack.....yetThe phone feels a little stiffer (opening clamshell) than what I was picturing in my head. I thought back to the days of the V3 and this 5g version flirts with feeling. Genie, I wish for this to have a ui option that looks like the old V3 layout when making a call..Genie,Christina?? Update: I found it.I like having a satisfying [snap] when I end a call. I don't get that from [push the red button].It is like those new Chevy BelAirs that you can only get from certain mechanic shops. New chassis, modern technology, old great lines body style. This phone is made to kick up the nostalgia and it will 'roadhouse' kick you and everyone around it. That is...if you had a Razr 15 years ago. But so far, I have been given complements and younger people want to know more information on the second screen; when they see me typing and watching YT on it.Battery: I've only had phone for a few hours. Would it be nice, yes but I rate it 'eh, don't bother me'. If your a heavy user, check the professional reviewers.Setup was easy however I did not finish it yet. I'm like mostly through it. Android 10 is easy to work with. Cradling the phone in my hand(s) feels nice while I type (or swipe) on the keyboard. FP scanner integrated into Motorola symbol is a nice and refreshing touch.Pictures: The first is the speed test. 6pm on a Monday in Vegas. 5gE. The others are some taken around town. No filters, just normal and pro mode. I did try 'enhance' on one and crop photo on two. I am not a picture guy so again try a professional review if that's your thing. Oh an animated smiley face on the second screen is a nice little touch.Scrolling: You can feel a little divot/bump/indent when your finger hits the middle of be the screen but it's barely noticeable unless you want to find it.Thanks for reading, AMA if your on the fence.

  falling in love with Motorola V3i from the first sign, using two v3i for 6 year until Motorola no longer make the next v3 razor after 2009, I have tried several android phones ( HTC Aria, EVO  series...) then landed at iPhone till now. Before place order for this razor, I don't think too much, I just have a feeling of seeing the ex girlfriend coming back promising that the relationship can be back as we use to be( can be love, sweet or bitter happiness ? don't care since you just live the life as you can breath in/out everyday). I love the iconic design , the way of folding the Rarz for answer and end the call with just open/close simply. It's so stylist and unique.To me the design of Razr is a legendary design that can live from times to times even now or 20 years later, it so creative and like no other at the time it launched, so manly when a man hold it, so secretly with lot of ...""fantasies"" to discover in a ...woman when you happened seeing her pass by you someday/somewhere on street. I don't really care for how much RAM, CPU, hardware...etc it has, because I will be using it in the most traditionally ways I can.I just got it , but don't open it in hand since the phone covers are on the way delivery.I will update the review for it when really in-hand and replace my iPhone now. It will be the main phone everyday, iPhone will be a backup.

Only buy for formfactor

  I only bought this phone due to its size and formfactor.  When folded, the phone is easily handled and very pocketable.  I also like that you don't have to worry about scratching the main screen as it is folded inside.  I definitely would recommend purchasing a cover of some kind as the phone is very slick.The screen is fine.  Some bends are visible, but they do not bother me. It is otherwise a colorful and bright screen.  The uneveness of the screen is really only noticeable if looking at it from certain angles.  Straight on, the bends are barely noticeable.The outer screen is very functional and you are able to quickly check any messages or emails without opening the phone.  The outer screen also allows you to respond to messages by typing your response.Overall, not worth $1400 unless you want this formfactor of a phone.  Pictures/videos are fine, but that is not a priority for me.  I also like that the phone is not full of branded software.

  I like the way it folds up and goes into my pocket but I hate several things:The screen goes black when I am on a call.Google assistant interrupts spontaneously. I can’t kill it. It listens to conversation and makes comments.You need two hands to open the phone.It makes alert sounds without telling me what the alert is for.Too much money for how much I hate it.

Latest packaging is a bit different
","

  I read the other reviews about the phone being folded in the package.  I believe Motorola updated the method of packaging the phone in their box.  If you place phone in the box open, it will rattle around.  Folded the foam insert in the lid holds the phone in place securely.  As for the screen cover, mine did not have one either.  Perhaps they found it could possible damage the plastic screen upon removal?  Just a few thoughts.Personally still trying out the phone.  Went from a OnePlus series to this one due to having a original razr years ago.  (Still have it actually).  So far I'm enjoying it, even with its limitations.The phone is very slippery and a case is definitely welcome.  I've not found any, but one that provides a raised edge to allow one's thumb to use this to open the phone single handed.  Right now I feel that two hands are required to open it, being careful not to drop it.The only issues I've noticed so far with regular use is that my bluetooth will skip or hesitate while streaming music.  Using PowerAMP as my music player with audio flac files.  With me Shure SE535 in ear phones, the music stops starts at times.  Trying to sort out if it is the outer touch screen causing issues while in pocket or the headset itself that causes the pauses.  Despite the specs not mentioning it, the phone does allow use of aptX-HD for playback through bluetooth.The plastic screen is a pleasure to use.  It does show uneven lines left to right, but in use those are not an issue.  The feel is very good and responsive to the touch.I would like to see Motorola add some grippy surface to the side buttons.  They are too slippery and sometimes difficult to operate.  Especially the volume rocker, it is too small.

Totally Digging It
","

  It costs too much. I keep trying to justify it but yikes, over a K for this:SSS #bankruptcyAnywho, moving on: I LOVE IT.The open/close is awesome and feels solid, not fragile. The design is so that you can't ""over open"" it, which also lets you know when you got it securely opened it won't just ""fold closed"" on you during use, you have to make effort to close. And it closes smooth.Main complaint? It's EXTREMELY slick, like, VERY slippery until your fingers/hands adjust. Took a little to learn how to ult/open it without the enormous fear of dropping it and damaging the OLED screen (still have nightmares about that, btw) lolAs far as capabilities and function: looks gorgeous, responds GREAT, offers a ton, and I also don't use the front screen NEARLY as much as I thought I would. It does have some weight to it, but it's fine. Folded, it is ever so slightly thick but not awkwardly so. Quickly got used to it in my pocket. Again, hardest part was learning how to hold/handle it without it slipping.I wanted to use a screen protector on it but most of the ones out there are for the older version and DO NOT work on the Razr 5G, so please be VERY careful if purchasing a screen cover/protecter (I wasted 30 bucks on one.... :''''( couldn't refund cause I had ""opened it"" and didn't know it was the wrong front screen until I was about to apply it</3But even without the screen protector, it's been smooth sailing. I don't feel like I'm scratching it up even when using at work (which I often find myself with dusting/greasy/dirty hands from handling a MASSIVE variety of retail products and shop work). So yeah #boomThe camera is nice and quick to pull up. I have overall really enjoyed my experience with it and definitely have it as my primary phone. Don't have to keep switching anymore, and having the 256GB of space is AWESOME <3The folds in the screen aren't experience-destroying and are often not even noticed. I seriously have not found myself looking at the screen and being like ""welp, can't what that youtube because of the fold there"". Pretty much non-existent, very nice <33 :DI do wish there was a way to alleviate the fear that dust/debris is SLOWLY building up behind the fold. So paranoid xD :SSS :O :D

  I love it. It's beautiful. The new Motorola Razr packs a bunch of welcome improvements like more RAM, new cameras, support for 5G and a better processor. It is better than its predecessor, with more polish on the exterior, and substantially improved specs under the hood. I like the better battery life and better camera performance in medium and low-light situations. This is a nicely constructed phone that feels well built and solid.

Piece of art

  I am so honored to be able to own this luxurious piece of device. This phone is not available here in Canada but I knew I had to own it. I was about to purchase the RAZR 2019 when I heard that a second generation is on its way. So I was super excited waiting for the September 9 announcement. That day I learned that the Motorola had no plans to release the second generation Razr 5G to the Canadian market. I knew I had to get the phone so when it released on October 2 I ordered mine right from Amazon.com.  Took 13 days to get here and now that's it here I am truely admiring this phone. It works perfectly fine with the network here. On the even bigger plus side I am probably the only person in Canada to own this phone after release hahaha......

  I have been waiting for a phone that was compact, fits into my pocket enough to let me squat down to work and is a smart phone. This is that phone, it is smaller than my wallet. The only problems I have with it are the calls drop a little more than my old phone and it can get hot with major use, the inner screen is a lint magnet also.The outside screen is very useful for sending quick messages in hangouts or just ordinary texts. The camera is great, I don't take a huge amount of photos, but I noticed photos I took at night looked amazingly clear. Overall, I really love this phone, it catches a lot of people off guard to see a smart flip phone. Motorola, you did good.

  Great price for a decent midrange smart phone. Only drawbacks for me is that it's locked to net10 for a year(minimum) and you can't transfer your apps to the sd card. 16gb of internal storage of which the system is going to eat 9GB of and the ram is going to use up to 2gb. So when it's all said and done you're looking at 5/6GB useable internal storage. I know a workaround to be able to transfer apps to the sd card. Send me a message If you find yourself out of storage. Other than that I am quite happy with my purchase. Runs on android 10, good camera and I wasn't expecting it but it comes with usb type-c charging cable(a bit small. Only 2 or 2 1/2 foot cord).

Many pre-installed apps can't be removed, occupying much of the internal memory

  On prime day, I decided on the Galaxy A01 instead of the Moto E6. This phone was $10 higher for a slightly larger screen.The problem with the Galaxy A01 is that there is no ability to move apps to the external SD card and default apps that are not uninstallable eat up most of the 16GB internal storage. I wish specifications and reviews had mentioned this.From what I've read, the Moto E6 allows app installation on the external storage. I would've much opted for this phone had I known this information.I have my fingers crossed that the modding community will release a custom ROM allowing apps on an external SD card for the Galaxy A01.edit: found a video on YouTube that let's you partition the sd card as ""internal memory"". now I'm able to install apps on the sd card. upping my review to 3 stars.

  I bought this phone as a stop gap replacement phone because the battery suddenly died on my more expensive phone. I figured this phone would allow time to decide on a more expensive at a later date.Surprisingly I found this phone to be much more reliable than the more expensive phone that it replaced. The sound is much better and I can now hear all of my calls. Even the camera is better than phone it replaced and this one costs a lot less money. It also charges much faster than my previous phone.This phone doesn't have tons of bells and whistles, but I don't need that stuff. This phone is practical and most importantly to me reliable. It's much more reliable than my previous phone. I also got it on sale on one of  Amazon's annual sale dates, which made it even better!If you need a inexpensive reliable phone, this entry level Samsung A01 should definitely be a consideration. I give 4.5 out of 5 stars.

Great Cheap Phone
","

  For the price I paid, around $30, this phone exceeds my expectations. I use this phone as a wifi device for apps and such when I am just at home.Out of the box, my initial reaction was that it felt really small/slim compared to the Google Pixel XL I normally use.  Slimmer yet taller than the Nexus 5 I previously used.  Because I have large ape hands I bought a cheap case to not only protect it, but add a little girth.The screen is sharp and looks fantastic.  My only complaint being the notch for the camera in the center, but I wont subtract for that as it's just a minor annoyance.The device is pretty snappy when navigating with only the occasional hiccup/delay.  For the processor this has, I am quite happy with how it responds.  Will have to keep in mind that I have only loaded on a few apps and turned off a few others, so this likely helps.The battery holds a good charge for a good long time.  Obviously, only using this at home for apps and such over wifi definitely factors in.Overall, I think this phone is a fantastic device for younger people or those looking for a cheap replacement.

  Yes, this phone was purchased for my drone apps and works amazing with excellent battery life. No worries what permissions the apps use because I just use this to access the internet and apps for flying the fpv drones. What's great is it operates on both 2.4 and 5.8 wifi signals eliminating me needing my older separate phones. Clarity is amazing in the bright outdoors too. Another amazing thing is the gps works so well it auto calibrates my drones saving me time. The old phone had me spinning them to calibrate. Also, it actually will function fully horizontally with even the home screen. At 30 bucks this is worth every cent. I would imagine if I was using it as a phone for calling it would work perfectly. Screen is as clear and big as an iPhone X to me. So, yes totally  recommended.

I don't understand how this has any 5 stars!
","

  Okay so, I am guessing I got two lemons or something because this product should not have any five stars in my opinion. I bought one, and got it. I babied it. Putting a screen protector on it and an otterbox. I was so happy thinking I would have a phone better than my Motorola G6 lol!So I went to make my regular phone call. First off something you should know that IS NOT on anything on this page. This phone is finicky with what headsets that will work with it. I found that out when neither earbuds or my turtle beach phone xbox headset failed. (with both phones). And I googled it. Apparently it is a drawback with this phone.Second, the call was awful. On a normal phone call my voice went in and out constantly. I couldn't be heard except every other word or every third word. With or without a headset. My signal was at 3 bars and my battery was full. I got so frustrated I switched service back to my G6 which I could be heard as if I was sitting next to the person. So I returned the phone and got a replacement. I had 2 cases (One I got felt too flimsy so i ordered another) and a screen protector in it.The other one came.It was a little clearer call but did the same, except in discord it muted me (no i didn't mute myself). On top of that no matter what I did I had no notification for texts. NONE. I am not dumb I know how to set notifications for texts. I must say this is the most convoluted notifications settings I have seen.At first I had a tiny whisper of sound then eventually it went to nothing. Email notifications worked. Phone calls. But texts nothing. I changed the ringtones. Made sure the volume was all the way up. Turned settings off and then back on. Nothing worked.I decided to go back to my G6 until it bites the big one. I returned the phone. Thank you Amazon. :)I am guessing I got two lemons in a row. No phone with that bad call quality should have the high ratings it does. BTW in case you are saying the other person must have been the one with bad signal. No they had full bars.And i was stationary.So I am guessing I got two lemons but I am not going to go through that frustration again. Hope you all have better luck.

And on the Moto G Power that requires the bootloader to be unlocked. I tried explaining the situation to Tracfone and was met with a brick wall - ""no, sorry, we can't do that.

Good Budget Phone with issues. Missed an Opportunity to be a Great Phone.

  I have upgraded from Moto G6 -> Moto G7 Maxx -> Moto G Power.Newest 2020 G Power is good budget phone with 64GB of data space I appreciate even with optional MicroSD card. 4GB of Ram is great for retaining apps so I spend less time reloading. 2020 G Power phone is slightly faster than G7 Maxx, better resolution (difficult to tell by eyes), slightly larger screen, and better camera. It also has top and bottom stereo speakers.Now for few issues. Compared to G7 Maxx, battery life is slightly shorter (Probably due to higher screen resolution). Amazingly, power charger of 2020 G Power is rated at 10w, where as in G7 was 17w. So it takes about 25% longer to charge newer phone. I don't know why Motolora would do backward move. It should be faster not slower.Also 3 lens camera is better than G7 Maxx but still disappointing. Especially macro lens which is grainy and comes out too yellow. It is worthless. But I do prefer pin hole front facing camera compared to G7's notch design. It is less intrusive.Two speaker stereo is better setup than G7 but sound is not loud enough. When volume is at highest, speakers make a buzzing sound which bothers me.Finally, I don't know why, but fingerprint sensor of 2020 G Power is lot worse than G6 or G7. I bought two of 2020 G Power so I know that I did not get a defective phone. Both of my G Power have serious lag, misreading finger prints. Also I am puzzle as why 2020 G Power no longer has face unlock feature.Overall, it is good budget phone, specially at sale price. Most users would be happy with features and specs. But hopefully Motolora will make G9 phones without issues I mentioned above. I would like to upgrade again within a year.

  I bought an unlocked Moto G Power for my son for $250. I thought it was a great phone, so then when the same unlocked phone went on sale for $175 I bought one for myself as well. Great phone, and a good upgrade from my G7. Both my son and I use TracFone so when this G Power went on sale for $60 I bought it too figuring I'd give it a try an find some use for it. I took my TracFone sim card out of my unlocked phone and put it into this one and it works great, no phone calls to TracFone were necessary.Here are the downsides to the TracFone vs. the unlocked version that I can see:• Can't use sim cards from other carriers when you are traveling abroad (may not apply to you, but we travel abroad occasionally and get sim cards for the local carriers)• Loads some crap programs on to the phone that you can't remove: Games Hub, News Break, Pandora, Word Trip, Coin Master, 1Weather, Pop! Slots and probably some others I haven't noticed yet• I'm not sure if those apps that I can't remove are sharing my data in a way that I would object toStill, other than that it works like a Moto G Power phone, which is to say great. If it's cheap enough, this is a great back up phone, or even your main phone if you don't travel abroad. The File Manager app works the same and seems to be unrestricted. I wouldn't spend $150 for this phone if you can get the fully unlocked version which works just as well with TracFone for $175, but if it's on sale for $60, it's definitely worth getting. TracFone says they will unlock the phone after 12 months of paid use. I'll be even more impressed if that works when the time comes.

  The TracFone Motorola Moto G Power is an excellent value priced phone that can stand up and out against any of it's competitors in the 4GB Class. This phone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 chipset with 4GB of RAM. There’s 64GB of eMMC 5.1 storage, of which 48GB is available out of the box. While 48GB of storage should be enough for moderate users, you can add up to an additional 512GB of external storage with a microSD card. The Moto G Power still has the typical Motorola aesthetic, but there are a number of changes that make it look and feel more refined. For example, the front of the phone has a larger screen-to-body ratio, with no Motorola branding on the bottom bezel. Also, on the bottom edge you'll find a USB-C charging port, a headphone jack, and a speaker with opposing speaker on the top deck. Audio quality is solid as well. The phone features Dolby-tuned stereo speakers and AI that automatically tweaks audio settings depending on what you're doing. Though the Moto G Power is locked too TracFone, it is powered on Verizon's network making it an excellent purchase for TracFone's $30 pre-paid plan, which is offering a $5.00 two months discount if established with auto pay. The Moto G Power really delivers, offering snappy performance and truly spectacular battery life. So the bottom line for this purchase, it's a solid performance, multi-day battery life, and a gorgeous 6.4-inch display make the Moto G Power the best budget-friendly phone you can buy right now, hands down... Period!

Great phone with a few minor improvement areas
","

  I like this phone a lot--decent CPU, screen and size.  Amazing dual speakers.  On the downside, it is quite heavy and thick, likely because of the battery.  The battery lasts a long time since it is 5000mAH, but surprsingly about the same as my previous 4000 mah phone, I presume because of the larger screen and improved brightness electrical requirements.  I would recommend.

  I got a phone that did not work. It worked on wifi but would not connect to data. Was it not tested on data or what???  TMobile could not even get it to work. I had to spend an entire evening in the store working on a solution. TMobile got a very old error message that no one recognized and could not fix. Thankfully they worked with me on a solution to my phone problems but it took an entire evening!  Everyone has raved about getting refurbished/ renewed phones from Amazon... I'm the lucky one who ended up with a dud.

  Edit: BEWARE OF SELLER! Seller changed the phone model from the unlocked model to a t-mobile model in this page to try to avoid issues with false advertising.

Tiny scratches on the screen disappear once the screen turns on.Unlocked model: you have to manually flash the updates otherwise you are stuck with Android 8.You can also get a refund since the seller lied if the phone was flashed to the unlocked model.

Issues with the phone
","

  I love using voice to text and this microphone lags. I think it has something to do with the fact that it renews. A friend of mine also has a G7. I compared the response time for voice to text and his was 2 to 3 seconds faster. If I don't wait those seconds, it will skip over the first couple of words. It also routinely misses words even in the middle of the message and it has more incorrect words converted to text than any other phone I've had.  Also, for the last couple of months, the microphone won't work about 25% of the time. I'm in the middle of Phoenix, at different locations, and it won't work. I've never had this happen either. It's also frozen up a couple of times for 10 minutes. I couldn't even turn the phone off. The battery port stopped taking a charge about 2 months ago. I must rely only on wireless charging. My friend has not experienced any of these problems with his G7. This all started happening with 7 months of me using it. The bad microphone was an issue from day one.

Not perfect condition but a great phone

  The phone was in good condition and works wonderfully other than two things:- The screen has a small defect that can only be seen in certain situations. It comes from excessive pressure on a particular spot making it a very bright point. (I've seen it before with botched screen repair jobs).- The headphone jack and USB C port are scuffed up around them and it had some mild dust inside.Not really willing to return it because there's a possibility I could get a worse one and I'd have to wait for a replacement (also it doesn't look like they have any replacements to begin with). But other than that I'm fairly satisfied. Came with the original charger and cable and everything else is fine.

Awesome quality. Fails to update, returned
","

  Product is amazing and very good quality renew for sure. Looked brand new. 1 MAJOR thing that caused me to return the device was the fact that the phone ships with 8.0 oreo a 2+ year old outdated OS and it doesn't allow you to update even though the T-Mobile G7 is on android 10 with a higher security update as well. There's nothing to be able to be done about this also. So I returned to seller. But again for most it may not be an issues but for banking and overall security and device speed and features the updates are needed.

A few scratches. Works with MetroPCS

  I've had the phone for the past few days and it seems to work fine. I transferred from a MetroPCS Stylo 4 with no issues. The screen is not as a big nor is the battery of that phone, but everything else trumps it.Cosmetically, there were a few thin scratches on the screen, but you don't see them unless the screen is off. The back of the phone also has scuffs, but I put a case over it anyway. I got a screen protector as well. I was ready to send it back initially. It's a renewed phone, but I'll risk it this time. I'll update the review if anything changes.

  I don't usually buy refurbished items, and this phone just reminds me why. The screen flashes every time it goes to sleep. The alarm didn't go off several times and made me late for work.

  Battery only last maybe 5 hours using the phone. Always charging it. Speaker or phone is too low. When I have incoming alerts I never hear them because no matter what they are VERY low sounding. The volume boost is nice when on a call. Overall it it better then a cheap phone but I expected more like great battery life and being able to hear the speaking alerts. I can't even hear the notifications from most apps. And there is no way to make them any louder. If your looking at this phone, don't..upgrade or buy something other then LG. Sad for the NEW price of this phone. Thank God I didn't buy it new at new price.

  Never had such a fragile phone before. back and front are shattered after a few routine drops.  T-mobile version is pretty locked down too: no root, no capability to unlock bootloader, can't even unlock network via the factory installed app. unbelievably you cannot change the default SMS app which is pretty amazing. If you own the T-mo version just try it and be surprised (can't be done).  On the plus side it is a great size, is speedy, nice screen and camera.

Went from lg g5 -> lg g7
","

  Surprisingly I like lots of things about G5 better:  Form factor.  The extra length and thin bezels don't make it more useful, just heaver/longer and less pocketable.  Also with tiny bezels, fingers inevitably wrap around and obscure or touch things.  The touted speaker sound is actually clearly worse than the g5 under all circumstances.  Non-replacable battery makes me nervous.  Replacing the battery on the g5 bought a lot of device life.  Vaunted audio from the g7 headphone jack is too low volume to be satisfying when listening on my grado headphones, ended up using bluetooth phones so I prefer the g5 on this too.What I like better:  Much brighter screen.  Overly blue, but that is adjustable.  Works with new 600mhz bands.  Waterproof.  Seems to grab GPS and cell signals better.

  I am loving this phone. I especially like the camera. The phone is very light and thin. Battery life appears good. Refurbished phone was like new. Two minor negatives: (1) tool to remove a card /sim card flap was not included, but a straight pin worked. (2)Becausethis is not an ATT branded phone it will not do wifi calling. However even with the poor reception at my home it does complete my calls on the cellular net unlike the LG G4 it replaced.

Nice upgrade from my LG V20
","

  Pro's about this phone: Compared to a LG V20.$140It's an Amazon Renewed phone, it arrived in a plain white box with a LG Fast charger charger and USB C cable.It also arrived with a scratch on the back 1"" long but not very deep.The case I bought will take care of that.Other than that, it looks new, screen and corners are perfect.The battery lasts over 2 days but I'm not a power userThis phone is fast and responsive approx. 30% faster than my LG V20. Snap Dragon 845 vs 820.It boots up 30 seconds faster vs the V20.It's a slick looking phone but, definitely get a case for this, it's slippery because of the glass back.Con's about this phone:I miss the flip cover option my V20 has, but this doesn't.Larger screen seems smaller than my V20, Screen is 6.1"" but It feels like it's smallerthan the V20's 5.7"" screen, due to phone being narrower.There are many new features on this phone that will take some time to explore,but I feel most won't be used by me because I like simple designed things that are fast to use.It's a nice phone but wished I waited 1 week to buy it because it's $10 less.Bottom line: You don't need to spend a lot of $$ to get a previous generation $750 flagship phone.(you can buy a new one for under $300)

All the bells and whistles for a low price

  I spent many hours looking at review videos and looking closely at the specs on the Samsung S9 and the OnePlus 6 but this phone had all that I wanted and it was a great price. I was worried buying a refurbished phone but the price was worth the risk and I do not regret doing that. The phone came in a general box(well protected though) and only included the phone and a charger(which wasn't a fast charger and was Samsung branded). I didn't mind since I bought a fast charger later on. The speaker is great, fast, modern and feels really nice and sturdy. I have no complaints especially for the price.If you want a flagship phone will all the newest and greatest things but do not want to be like other people to happily pay over $1,000 for a phone, you will not be disappointed with this phone. If you want a phone that has 1 megapixel better quality, then go buy another phone but if that is the least of your issues, this is the one.**Update**It has been 4 months with the phone and it still is flawless. I even accidently took a swim with it and it still going strong. Forget paying $800 more for a similar phone. Its a shame stores like T Mobile and Beat Buy never advertise phones like these because they could save people the hassle of a 2 year payment plan 😒

Great Phone With Nice Camera | Didn't Come Unlocked but It Could Be Unlocked

  My phone arrived in perfect physical condition. No scratches, dings, dents, or cracks. All the buttons were intact and the included charger is great so far.When it arrived, it was locked to T-Mobile. However, if you're decent at looking up things online you should be able to figure it out fairly soon. It took me a while but that was because I needed my network's info.To unlock the device these are the steps I took:1. Find the Unlock App on the phone. For me, it was bundled in a T-Mobile folder.2. Tap Full Factory Unlock. It should give you a message saying it was accepted right away. For me, this unlocked the for for WiFi use but not on my mobile network.3. Google your network name + your country APN settings. So, for example if you use AT&T and live in the U.S. search ""AT&T U.S. APN settings.""4. On your G7, tap settings.5. Under Network, Tap Mobile Data6. Tap the three dots at the top right7. Tap Access Point Names (pictured)8. Input the necessary APN settings that you found in step 39. Your phone should be fully unlocked now. If not, restart it and it should be good to go.

  I recieved the phone in great condition. It works as it should and it was very easy for me to switch from my last phone to this phone. It came with a charger and a cable. Unfortunately I don't use the charger that it came with because it got really hot when I connected it to the outlet. The phone also didn't come with a sim card tray eject pin. I have to find something small enough in order to get the tray out. When rating the phone I give it 5 stars, but when rating the accessories I give them 2 stars. All together I'm satisfied with the phone, since it was the main product I purchased.

Great value for your money
","

  I bought this phone to replace a LG G3 6 weeks ago.  I activated it with a TMobile-compatible Tracfone SIM card, transferring my minutes, text and data from my old phone.  (It took Tracfone about 20 min. to solve activation issues on their end, but they finally got it right.)I love the phone: it is faster than the old one, runs a newer version of Android (9). TMobile seems to keep rolling out security patches, which is something AT&T didn't seem to do with the old phone.One of the things I like is that you can enable the battery saving mode all the time (in the old G3 you needed to be at 15% of battery to kick in), and you can customize two different battery saving modes.  Because I like the phone to automatically adjust the screen brightness, but I don't need it as bright as it sets it by default, I can set the maximum brightness to 80%.  With this setting the screen is more than bright enough, and it helps extend the battery life big time.  In all, I can go through 3 days with moderate use (not much internet surfing) and still have 50% of battery remaining.The screen resolution is also great, and you can even lower it to extend battery life without affecting the appearance too much.The fingerprint unlocking is a great feature, compared to a PIN; a lot faster.Overall, this phone is a great value for the money.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.

Great customer service!

  I purchased this phone from Re-Cell. First, I got the LG G7 ThinQ. I was impressed with the secure, small packaging, and a nice note inside. It even came with a screen protector already installed. The phone was shiny and beautiful. I love the G series for a mid range phone. However, there were a few problems with this refurbish.First, there was a sticky glue along one side when it arrived. Perhaps it was used to glue a new screen on. Not a big deal, after I cleaned with some rubbing alcohol. Right away, the phone showed some UI issues. The messaging app wouldn't load most the time. It would show a blank screen which I'd have to press the home button, refresh, and sometimes even restart the phone to get it going again. Second, the sound and call quality was terrible. Low bass sounds would come out screechy or the sound would go completely out. HOWEVER, these are possible issues you must be willing to accept on a refurbished phone. THE DIFFERENCE is in the Customer Service of your retailer!!That's when I sent an email to Re-Cell, and right away they replied to set up an exchange. They didn't have any more G7s, so they offered me an even exchange for a V40 (normally $60 more) or a reduced cost on a G8! I thought this was so nice, so I asked for the V40. They covered all shipping too!NOW, onto the V40 review. Again, I loved the small box packaging. It didn't come with a screen protector this time :( The phone has been great, it's beautiful to look at, has great specs ( I care about the camera mostly). I still sometimes get the issue of apps not opening correctly, but its rare. I've also read others having this problem online so it could be an LG issue. I've had the phone for a few months now with no major issues. I've dropped it (with a case on it) and had no breaks, scratches, or dents. I'm happy with my phone and the customer service I received from Re-Cell. I hope this review is helpful!

  I transferred the data from another LG phone to this one, and at first, that burned through 15% of the battery in 90 minutes, so I was concerned. However, that was an intensive process, and the next day by 6PM I still had 60% of the battery left, so my concerns that I'd need to charge it during the work day were unfounded. That was my major concern, how much battery (so to speak) would be left on a used phone. Other than that, you get aftermarket accessories (a charger and USB C cable), but the phone I received looked new and one of the 3 updates I got from T-mobile within the first 24 hours was an upgrade to Android 9. This phone (after having it just a few days) is an outstanding value. My previous phone was a LG Q7+, and that's a perfectly fine phone, but this thing is fast by comparison. Very satisfied so far. Everything has worked (T-mobile connection, WiFi, NFC, Bluetooth, charger) as expected as if new. Make sure you have T-mobile, this is not an unlocked phone.

Fine renewed phone, mine came just like new
","

  Packaging was white box, no manuals, just a generic charger and 3' USB C cable and a card telling how to get installation help and tech support from Amazon for 90 days.  Charger is a higher amp quick charge type.  Also included a pin to pop open the SIM card slot.Phone itself was perfect, no scratches or dings at all.  Put my T-Mobile SIM card and SD card in new phone and then upgrading from my LG G6 via wifi was a snap, just followed instructions for both phones to transfer data and it just flat worked.  One upgrade to Android current version later and it was up and running perfectly.Speed wise, I loved my G6 but busted the screen finally and was about the same cost to upgrade or fix it so I went the upgrade route.  G8 or some other 5G phone was too expensive and 5G is too new to go with it yet anyhow.  Google 5G limitations to see why the time for it isn't yet for me, too bleeding edge.  I'm usually on GB ethernet wifi at home so 5G doesn't matter to me.Only issue I had was SwftKey keyboard app didn't work and EverNote didn't transfer for reasons unknown.  Reinstalled SwftKey (best $0.99 I ever spent) and it worked.  Installed EverNote and it had all my notes in place.  I guess it picked them up from the SD card.Speed wise, I didn't expect it to be that much faster than my G6, but was very surprised at the speed difference between the two.  My G6 had an early snap dragon processor, so it's I guess two gens back from this G7 and that makes  a huge difference.I went on swapa and this phone does not show up as stolen or blacklisted in any way.  I did that first as if it was, I would have gone no further and returned it immediately.Overall, had no issues and recommend this phone from and this vendor, Amazon Renewed.  I only buy refurbished stuff directly from Amazon, no other vendors because of warranty service and no quibble returns.

To buy ""renewed"" or brand-new.  That is the question.

  I was very skeptical going into this purchase.  Even more so when I noticed Amazon went away from the ”refurbished” branding to the ”renewed” branding.  But i took a chance and I have to say that, in my case, those fears have been unwarranted.  The phone arrived in an unmarked, aftermarket box.  No big deal.  I get it open and the phone is immaculate.  It looks brand new.  It came with a charger and one of those little pins to eject the sim tray.  There were no issues with the imei or the phone being blacklisted.  I have metro PCS and had no trouble activating it.  It works perfectly so far.  Overall it is a great phone and would never know it was ""renewed"" by Amazon.  This doesn't mean I'm all about buying renewed phones, but it really is hard to argue with the price.  I'm happy with it.

Pretty decent if you get it on sale

  Not a bad phone Works decently. But I basically just use it for calls and streaming to my TV. It will Miracast from the phone data if you let the Wi-Fi stay on without being connected to any Wi-Fi. Make sure it is not hooked up to your Wi-Fi just put forget on the signal connect to your TV or Android box and you're good to go U will be using your data. If you turn the Wi-Fi off it will disconnect your Miracast. This device it's called Smart Share and it is on your pull-down bar second page. This phone is usually on sale between 350 and 450. The u.s. unlocked version works okay with T-Mobile. One issue is the continuous bloatware ads for updating and or other apps. Just go to settings and apps. Find the Samsung Push go into that one and turn off notifications. Don't worry it won't affect your normal ones only the Samsung garbage! If you set up a Samsung account don't use dual protection because I still can't get it to send a code to my email or text just so I can get into the app. It's a big issue! I'm still trying to figure out how to get into the app because of that dual layer I put in my passcode and then it tells me to get another one. I can't even update Bixby because it won't let you do anything without first Accessing the app this is a major pain. Pros of this phone Miracast without a Samsung app screen shares without Wi-Fi hooked up for pairing just make sure it's activated and not hooked up to a Wi-Fi site use your unlimited data and have fun.! This works with the TLC Roku TV and my Android box. Another thing is you can get it to fill your TV screen when your TV doesn't have stretch. Unless the app you're using letter boxes the movies or shows on its own. Conn's. Bloatware takes up tons of data space of 128 gigs you only have about 98 left after you download a couple of apps like games and streaming sites I have 5 streaming sites and a couple of under 300 megabyte games leaving 98. You won't find a storage setting it's under device care. Fine-looking I can't tell for sure it appears that system memory uses 20.1 GB which leaves you about 108 that's a lot of garbage pre-loaded on the phone. However I have a T-Mobile version. You will continually get asked to update Bixby whatever that is. If you don't bypass the Samsung account setup part. Have a pen ready because Samsung password has to have complications you'll see what I mean can't use what you want! You have to put in it what they tell you or it won't work! But this is the Samsung thing and it really sucks! Google accounts do the same thing now which also sucks! Why can't we use what we want to for passwords anymore. And one more thing these new phones are tall and thin which shrinks the size of things on the screen. It reminds me more like a coffin than a phone! I think this was the stupidest thing they ever did because size is everything. But you got to go with what you can afford unfortunately it seems like most of the companies are going to this style which is absolutely the stupidest thing I've ever seen what a waste of space! The icons text ECT. Are about the same size they would be if the screen was 5.8. At least when you go to your coffin you won't be surprised about the fit because you'll be looking at a coffin every time you use your phone. At least that's what it reminds me of but the LG velvet is worse it looks like a coffin for a basketball player I would definitely choose this phone over that one. One other feature the sound is okay for voice calls and the speaker you can hear things okay when you're not on the speakerphone. I would say reasonable not great but nothing to send the phone back for because it's okay I've had tons worse! What other flaw the battery so-called Quick Charge really ain't no such thing. At 90 minutes it takes 20 minutes the charge 10% and it does say fast charging that's a joke. That's normal charging speed for a couple of my phones!

  I feel as though these answers are purposely vague in order to not show customers the true limitations of the product. So let's break it down:1. You *can* connect yout BT headset.2. You *can* take an incoming landline call on your BT headset.3. You *CANNOT* make an outgoing landline call through the VsTech handset and have it connect to yourr BT headset.4. You *CANNOT* make an outgoing cell phone call through the VsTech handset and have it connect to your BT headset.5. You *CANNOT* receive an incoming cell phone call through the VsTech handset and have it connect to your BT headset.So, essentially, for anyone who purchased this as something to help them work remotely, it is useless. Completely useless. I have honestly never been so frustrated with a product I have purchased.

  Got this phone because of its Bluetooth capabilities and hoped to use my Flex headphones with it.  It also could pair with my cell phone.  It would not pair with my Flex headphones and I asked Vtech through Amazon if a certain Vtech headphones would pair and I was told it would.  It did not.  The sound quality was not very good either and the screen is difficult to read.  There are so many steps to get to a number in the phonebook and when you want to start something over, you need to put the phone back in the cradle for it to clear and you can start over again.I had Vtech phones in the 90s and I loved them so this was a great disappointment to me.

  Totally disappointed.  I used bluetooth to copy my iphone directory to the vtech phonebook.Then I find that there is no way to search the phonebook, and to make a call you have to scroll through the whole list, which is incredibly slow!  No beep-ahead, you just wait for each entry to refresh before going to the next.Second: the iphone is smart enough to insert a ""1"" before an area code, the vtech isn't.  So all my phonebook entries have to be edited to insert the ""1"".  A very painful process: the edit facility is not obvious.Third: sound quality is terrible.

Bluetooth does not work for outgoing calls

  Bought this phone for its Bluetooth Connectivity so that I can use my Bluetooth Headset for incoming and outgoing conference calls. While the headphones work perfectly for incoming calls, it could not be used for outgoing calls.

Only one feature works with Bluetooth pairing with Apple iphone

  We eliminated our landline and read that VTech offered a phone that would enable us to use a landline type phone for our calls if we paired our phones. There was no problem pairing the phones. When the cell phone rings, the VTech phone rings. If you are within 30 feet of the base and your cell phone is near the base, the phone works well for incoming and outgoing calls. No matter how many times we read the manual and redid the steps necessary for the answering machine element to work, it will not record calls nor will it let us know if we have had any calls. We still need to consult our cell phone for that. So, it is basically a good phone if you have an issue with making and picking up calls on a cell phone.  I have tried customer support from Amazon and they merely read the manual instructions to you. I have done that. I also tried to contact customer service for VTech on their website but there website only offers FAQ site at this time.  I have not yet tried calling them to see if it is the Apple phone or our service that is causing the problems. And yes, we did try changing the number of rings . We went through the entire spectrum, still no success with the machine actually working for any function except making calls and receiving calls.

  I bought this phone because my current phone was having echo issues with listeners.  So after trying everything I could think off, I tried a new phone.It didn't last one phone call.  Not broken, but not usable for me.  I work from home so I need a phone that I can walk around, type and use without holding the phone to my ear.  I never got the Bluetooth headset to work (it paired fine, but I never could hear a dial tone in the headset), but even so... it's tied to the base unit.  Means it would only have 30ft range under the best of conditions.  Add walls and floors and that 30ft is more like 10.My current phone has a wired 2.5mm headphone jack and I have a range extender which lets me go anywhere on my property, hands free.

Doesn't work for Answering Bluetooth!
","

  Please be advised that the Bluetooth function of this phone will not operate as advertised if you are connecting using an Apple Iphone.  Apparently the latest Apple update (10.1.1) will not allow the Iphone to readily connect to the V-tech phone for incoming calls. Fortunately it is possible to make outgoing calls using the V-tech system directly without actually accessing the Iphone.Here is what happens.  When the Iphone receives an incoming call the V-tech phones will ring (provided the Bluetooth is set up) but it will not make the Bluetooth voice connection.  On the Iphone instrument it will indicate choices as to how to direct the call.  First a screen will appear that shows circled choices for: MUTE, KEYPAD, AUDIO (with Bluetooth symbol), ADD CALLS, FACE TIME, CONTACTS.  By selecting AUDIO the Iphone will bring up another page with three more choices: Iphone, the V-tech (Bluetooth) and Speaker (it wants to know how to answer this incoming call).  Once V-tech is selected, the call will be transferred to the V-tech instruments.  Unfortunately this situation negates the possibility of answering the V-tech remote phones because you must have the Iphone physically available in order to make the answering selection.

Good but not great

  The device connected easily via Bluetooth to our cellphone and has worked well for receiving and making calls.  The answering system however will not answer incoming calls as I had expected.  That was not the main reason we bought the device, but it was going to be a nice feature to not have to call our mobile provider to get voice mail.  My main reason for giving only an average rating is with the marketing and documentation for that feature.  It was not made clear of the limitations when using the Bluetooth option and only when I called tech support that I learned that the answering system would work with a cell phone. The device has served well for its main purpose to be a cordless extension to the cell phone that we just added to replace our land line using the phone number that we have had for 30 years.

  First and foremost, if you have a loss of power or hickup, you will have to reprogram your date and time, can't believe they made this without that common feature, next you are allowed to mount the base unit on the wall but not the handset extensions, if I had known this I definitely would not have bought this and three extra handsets.

  Finally got it working and it does everything as advertised.  I could only give it 4 stars due to a technical issue.  DO NOT install the batteries in the handsets until the base is plugged in.  Give it a few minutes and then install the batteries.  If you install the batteries first, the base and handset will not communicate.  You will not be able to use your cell phones with the handset.  The base will pair, and act as a ringer but that's it.  The handset will say ""Out of range or no pwr at base"".  Tech support was awesome, and helped me fix this issue.

  We purchased this item to have in our home so that we could hear when our cell phones rang.  We don't have a landline we would often miss calls if our cell phones were on vibrate, on the charger in another room, or if we were upstairs and the phone was downstairs.  We bought this and put one downstairs and one upstairs.  Now, any time our phones ring, these phones ring, too!  No more worrying about missing a call.  Even my kids can answer the phone if they need and can't find my cell phone.  Another great feature is that I can use this if my phone is on the charger.  No more being chained to the wall charger!The only problem we've had is that sometimes the bluetooth connection drops.  We haven't ever had this happen during a call though, just occasionally if we've been away and came back.  We just have to make sure they are connected when we're home.  Not a big deal.This works for two different cell phones at the same time.  You can see whose phone is ringing by the display.  You can download your contacts to the phone, but we haven't ever used it.

  Works pretty well. I got it for my elderly mom who was struggling with using her cell phone and has no land-line.  This takes her back to a time when phones were not so complicated, and she can use it easily.  A lifesaver, now I can call and check on her instead of always getting her cell phone voice mail because her cell phone was dead somewhere in her bedroom.  She never needs her cell phone away from home, so it can just be left set up.  One is in her bedroom, one in the living area.  If the cell phone is ever taken off the VTech phone, well I will probably need to go set it up for her again.  The sound quality is really good, and she can hear me much better than she could on the cell phone by itself.  The ring tone is nice and loud and she can hear it easily even with her reduced hearing ability.  I would recommend it for anyone who is cell-phone challenged, or is hard of hearing with no land-line backup.  I might even get one for myself, cell phones still just aren't as good in the sound quality department as a good solid land line phone, so having my cell hooked up to our land line phone would be a good thing.

  We have been wanting to get rid of our land line to save money. However, my wife didn't like the idea of using just our cell phones. She was concerned if we would hear them depending on what room we were in or if we forgot to unmute them. This was a perfect solution. Once connected via Bluetooth we have 3 phones to answer any calls. They were easy to connect our cell phones to the system. I was even able to load our contacts. I have not figured out yet how to use the contacts on the phone yet. I wish when someone called it showed the number and not the name of the cell, like Samsung J7. The other is sometimes they don't sync and you need to force them.

Others have complained about noise or voice quality but I have not experienced any problems yet and I have been using it for 2 months. i think the noise or interference is frequency  related from other devices near the base unit placement or while using the headset and have been the case in many instances while in my electrical engineer career.

  We get terrible cell service in our home and my husband cannot miss a call or text for work. We also do not have a landline.  Right out of the box it took maybe two minutes to pair the phone with our cell phones.  Very easy!  We set it up in an area that gets decent reception and left our cell phones next to it.  The calls that came in on the cell were taken on the VTech and the clarity was much better than our cell phones.  Sadly, we did not receive text notifications and that is a deal breaker.  I called customer service and the tech was very helpful however my Amazon Fire phone as well as my husband's iPhone 6 are not supported for the text notification.  You need to have an android 2.3 in order to receive texts.  I hate to have to return it because otherwise it is awesome and better priced than the Panasonic Link2Cell.

  works as intended, turned mother-in-laws flip phone into a ""fake"" landline, she loves it and it fulfills her need for a ""real"" phone line. takes two minutes to set up and then it auto connects to her phone the moment she hits the front door with no need to press any buttons.  She's old school and has no idea how the magic works...but it works flawlessly behind the scene

Great Product!

  I purchased this phone set for my daddy. He uses his cell phone as his home phone, so he was so excited to be able to use these via Bluetooth.  He's older so this phone allows him to have a louder ringer and a lesser chance of missing calls since there are several handsets. He loves this phone set and I'm glad to have made this purchase.

And despite this, upon request for a replacement, I asked could I be sent a phone that was not attached to a an account and was told that the phones are only GSM unlocked, which is odd seeing as how the phone I had was attached to a Sprint account, which is CDMA.

Phone does not work correctly with AT&T

  I bought one wanting to use it with AT&T (which is a GSM carrier).  The phone contained a Sprint ROM - meaning that it includes all of the Sprint built-in apps as though I had bought it from a Sprint store.While it was unlocked and technically able to be used with any carrier, Sprint keeps popping up a message asking me to activate it on their network - even though I had an AT&T SIM card in there.  And on top of that, it wouldn't let me run any software updates - it said that the version of the OS was not valid.I'm sure it would all be perfectly fine if I actually wanted to use Sprint, but we have an AT&T plan and need either an AT&T ROM or a standard Samsung ROM.

Good product but not complete out of the box experience
","

  I bought this product with high hopes and was looking for a budget phone. The phone Samsung S10e is first of all, an amazing phone all around. It meets my standard of a good Samsung quality. I loved how it looks and feel of it all. The phone itself is very snappy and I had it all set up for a long time use but then... I was disappointed.Main 2 issue I had with this phone are Battery life and power. When I first received the phone it was completely dead no power at all but I was like okay maybe it just needs to charge.. so I did. After while I have been using it for a day or two.. it was great but realized the battery drains quickly.. and phone turns off abruptly when it’s not in use.A good example I can say is whenI used the phone for good 1 hour or 2 watching videos, phone calls, text etc.. but when I set the phone down for bit and picked it back up it shuts down. When I turn it on it’s a big struggle. I would have to hold power for good 2 minutes or when I get frustrated I plug in power and then it actually turns on. It is extremely annoying and irritating especially when I need to use the phone in emergency case I cannot use it because phone abruptly turns off completely. The phone itself works perfectly fine when it is powered on but when it turns of it really turns off for good time until you press really good on the power and hope it will turn on again.. I hope to get a replacement from the seller because I really do like the phone I am just not happy with the main function that gives the phone its life.. battery and power.PROS: Bright display, snappy function, internal functions great, cameras great, Sim UnlockedCONS: Power Issue and battery life, some scratches..

Good phone but poor vendor (read review)
","

  This is a great phone. I switched from an lg v30 and the most glaring difference is the screen. The screen is not a high end OLED, so the color difference was slightly jarring. Generally just not as vivid. And the holepunch front camera doesnt get in the way either. Other than that it is better than the v30, although pricier today.  The problem is with the seller. This is labeled as unlocked and i recieved a verizon phone. Wasn't an issue for me as i use verizon, but this is plain incompetent. And a minor complaint but not a glaring issue is that there was a scuff on the screen upon recieving the phone. Its not super noticeable but discolors when a bright color is displayed behind it.

  I loved the phone and used it for about a month before it started to power loop (freeze, and turn off).  The local store associated with Samsung was going to fix it, but it apparently had a motherboard issue and they could not do it. They assured me that Samsung would fix it if I sent it out to them. This was after two weeks of them having my phone and not informing me sooner that they were unable to fix it.So, I sent to Samsung.  They charged me for the back cover because it had a tiny crack in it and refused to fix they're manufacturing issue with the phone.  They after approximately 4 weeks or more of having my phone, many long terribly unhelpful phone calls and exchanges, claimed that it is now past warranty (though it was a manufacturing error to begin with) and that they needed the phones IMEI number.This is impossible since I don't keep the receipts from purchases over several months old. Secondly, I tried to use the Amazon receipt, they wouldn't except it. Thirdly, I tried to contact the buyer to give me the IMEI number on the phone they sold, in which they had no idea whatsoever what phone goes to which buyer.Samsung canceled my ticket number, sent my phone back still broken, charged me $118 to replace the back phone cover (an unnecessary and unwanted fix, but they couldn't continue until they fix 'ALL' the problems and threatened that until I paid it to be fixed or they'd send it back broken...ha what a joke) and when I finally got the phone in the mail, I had to pay for postage to send it back to this seller on Amazon!Amazing experience. Worst companies I've ever dealt with.

  Overall phone is excellent. At first I had a lil trouble with it being quite warm during normal use, with touch sensitivity and with notification panel not being able to be pulled down. Did some research on google and was able to find a work-around for the notification panel and touch sensitivity. And also found solution for the warm-ness. No problem with that since.  Later my phone updated (twice) and then the notification panel issue was fixed. I have no idea which processor I have but I dnt think that kind of stuff will bother me. Touch sensitivity is still not GREAT but it's not nearly as bad. Overall , very happy and satisfied I was FINALLY able to get the phone I wanted (and pay for it outright). I've been waiting and searching all over since the release last year.4 stars just bc of the few issues I initially had.*update 7/2Tried to take a few pics-front camera is good, no issues. However,  the rear camera is blurry/fuzzy and has sort of a haze. I have cleaned it and also tried different settings, nothing works. (Maybe that's why the previous owner let it go...)Now I'm getting disappointed. This phone has a great camera and now I can't really use it. I have already activated service on this phone so sending it back for a replacement would be a headache. Will contact customer service.Bumped down to 3 stars.

Strange charger included

  The phone itself was perfectly fine.  There were no visible scratches when I got it.  The fingerprint reader is fine as well, in a bit of a strange position, but fine.  The primary reason for my rating is the charger I received.  While it was the correct charger for the phone, the part that plugs into the phone was too... short?  It won't stay in the phone, and the phone won't recognize it's there.  You'll have to buy a separate charger.  When quick charging, the phone charges up in 2 hours.  When using the charger that was supplied (after I cut back the plastic that prevented it from working), the charge-up time was listed at 9 1/2 hours.

Beware of seller Deals Always

  Zero customer support after the purchase.  Don't expect any assistance after you spend your money. Seller will also try to convince you that the Amazon refurbished guarantee does not cover software issues. Don't fall for it. Keeping the phone because I can manage the problems but it does not work fully as it was intended to (which is expressly covered by the Amazon Guarantee, regardless of if it's hardware or software.)Otherwise, the Samsung s10e is a decent phone if you're not looking for a high-tech purchase. The screen is sharp and bright, and I personally like the smaller size to fit in my hand comfortably.

Beautiful like new device, terrible customer service

  Just to start this review off, wanted to say I got my device from the seller Chubbiestech (when you look at the reviews for this product it doesn't say what seller they recieved their phone from).My phone is perfect. It looks and works just like a new one. It came packaged well with a new third party charger and adapter. I love it with all my heart :^) Dont be scared by some of the reviews. I dont know if I just got lucky but I have Verizon and changed my service to this phone with absolutely no problems.On the customer service tip, I did have a hard time getting the sd card slot out (which I guess is harder than my previous phone because of the build). I thought it was stuck so I called the number listed on the little pamphlet that came with my order. This lady that sounds like she just woke up in her living room answers the phone. She had an attitude as soon as she started talking. Was probably the rudest customer service person I've ever spoken with in my life. Everything she said was rude and at times she seemed like she was half laughing like something was funny. When I told her my problem (for the second time, because she ""couldn't understand me"" the first time), she said ""Well I don't know what you expect me to do, I don't have the phone in front of me."" When I asked her if I should just force it she repeated that same thing and added that if I forced it and anything broke I couldn't return it, and that I should watch a youtube video on how to get it to work!!Overall I'm very happy with my new phone, but cross your fingers that it works right and be prepared to return it lol.

  Overall, it's a very good phone. I upgraded from an old S6 and I'm enjoying the increased speed and battery life. The fingerprint reader on the side is lightning fast. I still have to learn a bit more about how to best utilize the features.The vendor was terrific. It arrived right on time (or maybe early - I don't recall), even though the packaging was generic - the phone seemed brand new. One disappointment was that the charger was an off brand. I contacted the vendor and they explained that renewed items don't necessarily come with original chargers. But they told me they would send me a Samsung brand and I got it in a day or two! Great customer service.My biggest complaint is that even though it was listed as Verizon compatible, some features don't work. I contacted Verizon to have them help me troubleshoot why I couldn't listen to voicemail messages without having to place a call. After two or three reps the top tier rep told me that it's because it's not a ""Verizon"" phone. There are a couple of other features that may not be available, but that's the one that bugs me the most. This was the first time I bought a phone from anyone other than an authorized Verizon dealer, so that may just be standard.Bottom line? Excellent vendor and a very good phone.

Great Phone Overall, Except Non-removable Battery is a Downside, Especially For a High-End Phone
","

  I really like this phone.However, I have one main complaint about it, which is that it doesn't have an openable case and removable battery. I've replaced the battery on 2 out of the last 4 android phones I've owned, and I tend to do so on the more expensive phones. This would be one of the more expensive phones I've owned, so I'm probably going to own in long enough that that's an issue, and it's annoying that not only this model doesn't have a removable battery, but that none of the recent Samsung models other than the XCover series (which don't work on my carrier, T-mobile) offer such a feature. Shame on Samsung and T-mobile for failing to deliver a feature that I most want, especially on a high-end phone that I tend to want to own for 4+ years.Another minor complaint, which is sort of related to the phone because it's Samsung, is that the Samsung ""Smart Switch"" app failed repeatedly when trying to transfer messages from my old phone, and I wasted a couple of hours in my life in the process and finally gave up at transferring all my messages. For a phone of such high hardware specs (8-core processor, lots of RAM) there is no technical reason for it to struggle so much, being so slow and failing multiple times, at transferring a relatively small amount of data (~2GB, 100K messages.)Besides that, I have few complaints about the phone. The hardware is great, processor is fast, camera works great, battery life is good, and it's quite small and compact yet they've somehow managed to make the display a bit larger by eliminating more of the unused space at the screen margins. I also like the location of the power and volume buttons. I could do without Bixby and some of the more invasive modern features, but again this is a complaint about the smartphone industry as a whole, pretty much all the companies are doing awful stuff like that.Compared to other phones this is a good model.And I'm glad I bought a ""renewed"" refurbished one. It arrived like-new and has worked flawlessly, and saved me well over 1/3rd the cost of a new phone.

Small enough to be a big improvement! A quality alternative if you hate large phones.
","

  Finally a smaller, high quality android phone that will work on Verizon. So tired of the recent trend for huge slab phones that you cannot put in any women's clothing pocket.  This phone is attractive, feels good in the hand as well.  I find only 2 annoyances: 1)  simply reaching to pick up the phone almost always results in an accidental press of one or more of the edge buttons, thus inadvertently silencing, dismissing whatever alert prompted the attempt, or hanging up on incoming calls as I attempt to answer.  and 2) the default samsung keyboard that has talk to text ability, is really very bad. I think the developers have a dark sense of humor, and that the majority of those hilarious miss-typed text threads we see on the web, probably came from a samsung. While you can use the google keyboard which works much better, I have found no way to make that the default. So you have to actively open it and select it each time you wish to speak a text message, or enter a search.  Actually, even if you want to use the samsung keyboard you must actively select the one with the microphone each time. They need to update this to allow user to set the desired default keyboard. Not sure why any keyboard apps even exist that don't have a speak to type feature anymore. Yet that is the kind that this phone 'defaults' to in texts and searches. Over all though, a very good little phone and I am glad Samsung made this smaller phone.

Was the right purchase for the money.

  I have owned this phone for several months now and I feel like i got a good price on this ""Renewed"" phone at roughly half the price of a new one.  However, it does not feel like a new phone and has never felt like a new phone.  I have purchased quite a few Renewed and Refurbished products over the years and none ov them felt as ""Renewed"" ""Renewed"" as this one.  To say that a different way, this phone felt used from day 1.  I didn't have a lot of money at the time i purchased this phone, and i needed a phone so i couldn't return, so i can't complain too much, and again, the price was absolutely right.  But this felt like i got what i paid for, like it is half the phone it should/could be.  Having said that, i would still recommend it at half price or less of a new phone to anyone that is struggling with money but needs a phone,  even the Renewed phone is still better than many other phones at that price point.

  I was hesitant to buy given the mixed reviews, but with Amazon return policy figured there was no financial risk.  The phone I received was in perfect condition, no visible scratches font, side, or back, has a clean IMEI number, and was unlocked.  No hiccups at all during setup. It came with an off-brand charger and cable.  The charger does not have sufficient amps to correctly charge the phone, but works fine for older devices (this is why I knocked off 1 star).  I have a feeling that experience is dependent on the Amazon partner who sends the phone.  Mine came from 'Tech Exchangee'.

  I moved from Galaxy S7 edge to a Galaxy 10e, so I'm not sure how valuable my review would be to someone. The S10e is great. Here's a brief punch list of my impressions:Thumbprint reader on the upper right side: Some people say it is not convenient, but I think it is immeasurably better than the front lower reader on the S7 edge. On the S7 edge I have to shift my pinky to hook the bottom edge of the phone so I can re-position my hand and place thumb on the reader, then I have to move back to my normal holding position. On the S10e, my thumb is already in position- no shifting necessary. The S10e reader is much faster and accurate.Face recognition: My S7 edge did not have this feature. I had no idea how convenient face recognition could be! What a time saver!Size: The S10e is smaller than the S7 edge, but the diagonal screen dimension is slightly larger. The screen width of the S10e is slightly narrower than that of the S7 edge.Screen: The S10e has a lower screen resolution than my S7 edge, but I can't say I tell there is a difference to my naked eye. I knew this going in and chose the lower resolution for faster response, lower battery drain, and lower price. One thing I can tell is the difference in the ""immersion"" factor. The very curved S7 edge screen edges make the image somewhat more ""immersive"" than the flat screen of the S10e, but this is no big deal for me. The front camera makes a black  ""hole"" in upper right of the display, but this hole does not distract me.Battery: Without using power-hungry apps and only a few ""normal"" apps, it took 58 hours for the battery to drain from  100% to 5%, which is impressive compared to my S7 edge. Power-hungry apps drain the battery as you expect. I will continue to carry a power bank in my briefcase when traveling just-in-case (or maybe get a battery case)Charging Port: The USB-C on the S10e is a better charging port than the micro-USB on the S7 edge. I bought a pack of micro-USB to USB-C adapters (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LYR5F2X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and I am using my old charging cables with no problem.Camera:  I have only taken a few snapshots with the S10e, so I don't have anything to say. The specs of the S10e camera are better than the specs on the S7 edge camera, so I'm sure all will be fine.Summary: I bought the S10e as a ""renewed"" item on Amazon, and I am very happy with the phone and the price. After always being 2 to 3 generations behind in phone technology, I finally ""caught-up"" to the present, and did so at a reasonable price.

Best Galaxy Variant!

  This is truly a reliable version. there is no need for buying the S10 . The S10e is very reliable and the battery is literally all day of use! when the battery is at 10% - I can get 5 hours out of use! I will  not be upgrading anytime soon.

  I was so worried that the phone was only going to be carrier unlocked, but it did come factory unlocked. It had no scratches and was ready to set up from the start.

Great Deal & Fantastic Customer Service

  The phone was more than $200 cheaper than Verizon's price.  Activation was easy, just switch out SIM card.  Had it only a few days but so far very pleased.  Will provide update if my opinion changes. For now, this is a deal that you can't pass up.10/29/19 Have increased my rating by 1 star to 5.  Had the phone about a month now and am very happy with it. Had an issue with a bad cable, would charge but my PC would not recognize the phone when connected via USB. Seller identified the issue quickly and provided me with a resolution that is satisfactory to both of us.  I will be buying from this company in the future.  BTW, I got in touch with seller via amazon's order summary page and the Contact Seller link.  Very easy. Hybrid IT got back to me within an hour!!!

Totally worth it (T-Mobile - Upgraded from S8)
","

  While I do feel you are playing a little lottery when buying renewed, I do believe that odds are in your favor that you will receive a device virtually indistinguishable from what you'd get new out of the box at hundreds less.  I thought for sure mine would have at least some ""hairline"" scratches or at least SOME kind of minor cosmetic flaw, but it was flawless!  This might actually be the way I buy phones in the future as well.Thanks to being IP68, one of the first things I did was wash it off under the faucet.  The little adhesive stickers at the bottom were a little obnoxious, but I was able to completely remove them and rub off the remaining adhesive.Expect LOTS of system updates when you start this thing up.  There were 3 something system updates before I was even presented with the major Android 10 update (which is fantastic btw).  Then there were another 1 or two after that! Battery life also seems really solid -- something I was concerned with being pre-owned.Coming from an S8, the biggest difference I noticed is the UI.  The Snapdragon 855 is also significantly faster, though you won't notice a difference in most cases.  Didn't test the camera much, but it's supposed to be considerably better.  The wide angle less is also nice addition.  As someone who prefers my phone naked, it's much easier to use in hand thanks to NOT having curved edges.  Fingerprint reader also has a faster/accurate unlock than its other S10 siblings.  Overall I wouldn't consider this a huge leap over the S8, but it does offer enough new to appreciate.  The S8 is still an incredible phone even by 2020 standards.My budget allowed for any phone, but chose the S10e because I believe it's the best in the whole bunch.  I don't need the optical zoom, 8GB of RAM, or in-display fingerprint reader as found in the other models.  Plus the S10e is the perfect size.

Works great!

  Works great so far! I got it yesterday and haven't had any issues yet, besides the fact this didn't come with a data transfer cable. I don't mind because of the price. It comes with a charger and mine worked. I have Verizon, I did a test call with my friend for 45 minutes and there were no interruptions (speaker, no speaker, walking around). No lagging so far, and very fast. I'm waiting to see how it'll hold up with my 30 to 80 tabs I usually have in my browser.Ive never used a Samsung phone before and I'm really impressed with the ui and tools it has. Camera is really good if you can keep your hand still. Bluetooth and nfc work. I'm annoyed at the very rounded edges throughout the menus but i think that's something that can be fixed.I'm thankful to have gotten such a quality phone for this price! I will update if anything changes that can't be resolved though the seller.

Arrived in new condition
","

  Listed as ""renewed"", but arrived in new condition with original packaging.  Factory Unlocked, therefore it needed a Sprint SIM card to activate, but Sprint provided it free at the store.  Checked for software updates and phone displayed a message, ""Software invalid.  See Service Center.""  Sprint said it was a Samsung issue and recommended I go to the nearest ""UBreakIFix"" store.  Since the phone was still under warranty, the technician pushed the latest software to my phone in less than 30 minutes for FREE.  Highly recommend the techs at ""UBreakIFix"" store.  They have the latest Samsung diagnostic tools and firmware for Samsung phones.  Everything else works perfectly.

Got Phone in like new condition but had trouble with 4G/LTE (service provider problem)
","

  I bought this renewed phone and received an S10e in beautiful condition. When I had fully charged it and turned it on, the AT&T logo showed and I thought I might have a problem since I am using Total Wireless, a second tier carrier that uses the Verizon network. I ended up returning what was most probably a perfectly good item due to my service providers dropping the ball. They said the phone was incompatible and, I have since come to believe that was not the case.The listing included Verizon among the compatible carriers. Upon activation, I was able to make and receive calls but I had no 4g/LTE data connection, just WIFI. After delving into the problem with a customer service agent, I was advised that the phone was incompatible. AT&T uses GSM and Verizon uses CDMA so I thought the incompatibility verdict seemed reasonable.In working with the carriers CS agent, he had me go into settings>connections>mobile networks>network mode. There you will see a list with one of the choices checked indicating the setting the phone is on. He told me to select ""Global"" . When I told him there was no ""Global"" or ""LTE/CDMA"" selection, he said the phone was not compatible.  Pic 1 is my old S6, which I am replacing, and Pic 2 is the S10e.The CS agent also had me go into the Access Point Names. There was no access point listed, just some text saying ""not available to this user"" or something similar. No further input at all from the agent  on the access point angle, or why phone calls were working but not data, just ""the phone is not compatible"" Looking back now, at this point the agent should have walked me through setting up an access point. He didn't, so I sent back my ""incompatible"" phone.There was no problem at all returning the phone over the incompatibility issue. I then bought a second, used S10e from a different listing that described a Verizon phone so I figured I would be all set. Sure enough, it is a Verizon phone but imagine my surprise when I  encountered the exact same problem.Long story short, the FIX was that I need to manually set up/add an access point. I touched/opened the access point on my old S6 and replicated the settings  into the ""add access point"" on the S10e, and everything works fine.  I got the idea for the fix from a YouTube video. I guess they don't watch YouTube over at Total Wireless.I am certain this fix would have worked on the first, ""incompatible"" phone I ended up returning. I have since learned that the access point settings are supposed to download automatically on activation, but sometimes they don't. I would have expected a higher level of competency from my service provider's customer service. Ya Think? I can't help thinking that issues like this are deliberate corporate curveballs, designed to encourage customers to buy new phones direct from the carrier. JMHOTo sum up my review of this phone, I received an S10e in top notch condition and would highly recommend this renewed product.

Find another phone!!

  Do not buy this phone!  Cat supports it horribly.  First update, made it unusable as a phone, cat after 3 months still does not have a fix for this.  For the cost of this phone, it should work, and it doesn't.5 months later:  fixed the issue of the phone signal, and added a new one where it constantly loses the sim card and you have to reinsert it.  This is another software issue, it only happens when you access 4g networks.  The company that makes this (not Cat)is being sued out of existence, and their support of products shows why.  Good riddance!  Bottom line, CAT offers zero support on their phones, and the trick sensors all suck and are so inaccurate they are useless.  Find another phone to buy.

  When I first ordered this phone it took them an extra month to deliver it, once I got it I was happy, then everything went down hill from there.Issues galore, they release a phone with more bugs than and infested house, I cant understand why they don't make a phone, check that all features work well then send it out.Instead I got wifi issue, cellular issue and more, I will have to be deprived of my phone until it is fixed, with no hope of a replacement or a temporary unit until it is fixed, not worth the money for all the hassles. So sad this all happened I had such hopes for this phone, instead I now have a headache instead.15 emails to query, verify and hopefully get it sent to be fix, still nothing but emails atm, 2 weeks of correspondence and no results,. despite its impressive features, its not worth the trouble, I would not recommend this phone or the company to anyone.I should have kept my apple or moved to Samsung, I am very upset and tired of the fuss just to get a phone fixed, I can fix apple phones any where in the world or Samsung phones also any where without so much hassle.I am sad it didn't work out, I wish it did, seemed promising to have such a tough phone with so many features, I am writing this with a heavy heart and great disappointment.

Solid device-terrible customer support and warranty
","

  I bought this phone last September and up until July 5 I would have given this 5 stars all around.  However, the waterproofing somehow failed while I was wading in a lake and had the phone in my pocket. The screen had some distortion and after leaving it off, in rice in a warm place for a day I turned it on only to have it shut off.No big deal, I figured I'd just start a warranty claim. I sent customer support a message on July 6, and didn't hear back after a few days so I called the support number. I was told that they'd email me to request information on the device within the next day and that after I gave them that info I'd get a shipping label. I offered to give them all that info over the phone as I had it available right then but was told that ""it didn't work that way.""It took a day before I got the email, I immediately responded with the requested information. It then took more than a week and multiple emails and phone calls with customer support before I receiveda shipping label. I had the device in the mail that same day, but it took more than a week for the repair center to acknowledge that it received the device. I was told it would be 5-7 business days for the repair once the device arrived at the repair center. After two weeks I reached out again to customer support for an update and was told there repair center hadn't started working on it but that it was scheduled to be done the following week and sent back to me.That was last week, and now whenever I try to call customer support I never can get a human being to pick up, and while the system offers to let you leave a message and says that you'll get a return call within 24hrs the voicemail is full and cannot record any more messages.  I've emailed the customer service rep handling my case but haven't gotten a response in 6 days now.For a $999 (when I bought it) phone I'm appalled at the horrible customer service and warranty repair process. I'm now going on 6 weeks since I started this repair. I've never had warranty repair or replacement for a device drag on more than 10 days start to finish-and most take less than 5.

Screen sensors are not fine nor sensitive enough, it makes for tons of typing typos and nearly impossible gaming.

Now a year after that and my phone will shut off randomly throughout the day and my battery can be charged one minute and then almost dead the next minute. I have had it on the charger for hours and the phone told me it was at 0 percent. Support has not gotten back with me for weeks. Now I have to get a new phone and it won’t be cat. Unless you want a phone that only lasts a year go with a different phone.

Buy an S60
","

  Owned and abused a Cat S60 for two years. the only reason I upgraded is because the battery was not lasting very long. From day one I've had nothing but frustration with the cat s61. The touch screen is horrible, the word recognition is awful when texting, I dropped it one time on Hospital floor and it bent the casing, I don't feel nearly as confident that the covers over the ports will keep water out, plus one of the covers came off the rubber plug charging port. the air quality meter and Laser Rangefinder or cute but pointless for normal person. I had it about a year and now the screen is starting to flicker. In my opinion the cat S60 is a much more durable phone. the s61 does have better sound and a better camera but that's not why I bought the cat phone. I will be going back to using my S60 and just carrying an extra battery charger. Switched back to my S60 today and the difference is amazing. Better phone reception, lighter, touch screen works better and it's actually faster when browsing the internet. The S61 is not worth the asking price. Buy an S60.

Returned. Very disappointed.
","

  I had such high hopes for this thing. It pained me to return it.The good:-it's a TANK!-the thermal camera is SO COOL!-a laser distance meter? Yes please!-the air quality sensor was eye-opening. I had no idea my home's air quality was so subpar. I will buy a VOC air filter.-plain vanilla android with no annoying bloatware from a carrier-big batteryThe bad:-it's a TANK! It's HUGE! It's basically a phone permanently built into an otterbox from the factory. I can't stand a giant brick in my pocket.-The wifi kept going out and refusing to connect. I have about 15 devices on my wifi here, including other smartphones. None of them have any trouble whatsoever staying on the wifi. But for some reason, this thing only connects when it feels like it. (Yes, I played with all the settings.) Even if this can be fixed with an update or something, this phone has been out for a while. This is a glaring quality issue that concerns me.-The back button is on the left side. I'm right-handed, like most of the human population. That means I need two hands to press back because my thumb can't reach that far while holding the phone at the same time (because the phone is huge). So much for one-handed operation. I ended up buying an app that swaps the back button to the right for me, which I now regret because I've returned the phone for unrelated reasons.-Port covers! The 3.5mm jack and the usb port have port covers that you have to remove to access the ports. I did not realize this when I ordered it. The usb cover isn't too bad, but I had a HECK of a time trying to get the 3.5mm jack cover to go back on! It did NOT want to go back on correctly. I finally got it back on, but after much finessing/wrestling. There's NO WAY I'm going to fight with this thing every time I unplug my headphones, and I'm sure as heck not going to just leave it dangling. Terrible user experience, and a deal-breaker. Did you test this at all, Bullitt?? I remember when smartphones first started boasting IP-6x ratings 10 years ago. They used port covers to accomplish this (and they were annoying then too). But technology has advanced beyond needing these pesky prophylactics a loooong time ago. You can get an IP-65 (or better) phone from just about anyone these days without these silly covers. So why does the S61 need them? If it's for better dust protection, AT LEAST offer a version without the covers. I know that adds to supply chain overhead, but if every other manufacturer on the planet can offer different versions of their phones (64MB/128M, different colors, etc.), then you can at least offer this. Yes, it's worth the extra SKU. The covers are a god-awful vestige of ancient tech. Ditch them, or at least let me choose to ditch them.The camera. Where to begin...-Please understand, I'm not a camera snob by any stretch. As long as the thing works half decent, I'm happy. But this camera is so bad, even I can't stand it. See attached pic. I need this thing to be able to snap things like serial/model numbers off of parts, often in hard-to-reach, low light places. This camera won't do it. Now, using flash would probably help, but in my experience, flash tends to over-expose such pictures, and often cause glare the makes the numbers unreadable.-And that's not all about the camera - the camera is SLOOOOWWW! There's a 1 to 2 second delay after you press the button. I don't know how to explain how annoying that is, but it is. It also means you must be absolutely still while you're waiting for the camera to get around to actually snapping the pic. When you're bent over backwards and twisted around to get some numbers off an engine block, that's very hard to do. It's difficult not to be shaky. Really, Bullitt? (this phone was made by Bullitt Group, not Cat). I mean, seriously? You couldn't spend a few extra bucks on a modern camera? The technology is so available, yet you decided to use a module from, what, 10 years ago? I would've happily paid a little more to cover your cost for a decent camera. Another deal breaker. (And if you got the camera from Flir, then shame on you for not figuring out how to make the thermal imager work with a better camera. It's called R&D - FUND it! Your customers are smartphone customers, not thermal camera customers. Therefore, make a smartphone with a thermal camera, not the other way around)Summary:I was willing to try and get used to its bulkiness. I bought an app that moves the back button to the right where it belongs. I was even willing to call support and work with them with the wifi issues. But the port covers and the terrible camera broke the camel's back. 10 years ago, they would be excusable. But it's 2020, man. Look at your girlfriend's iPhone; you can drop that silly toy into a river and it won't miss a beat - and it doesn't have port covers! My galaxy S5 from forever ago could snap pics as fast as I could pull the trigger, and even in low light, the pics were plenty legible. It seems like Bullitt's idea of a rugged phone is to go dig up cheap, 10-year-old tech (the screen is straight out of an old galaxy S4, but that didn't bother me really), build an otterbox around it, plug up the holes with flimsy, poorly-fitting covers, and see if it can survive a 1 meter drop on concrete. If it can, then cram a Flir Lepton module in it, fire up the assembly line and call it a day! I can hear the execs now, ""QA? What QA? Usability testing? Enough of your mindless techno-babble! Go away, I'm trying to play golf here!""I returned it. I now have a Galaxy S10e. Sure, it's not nearly as rugged, and I hate sending my money overseas, but at least it doesn't annoy the heck out of me. I'll just put it in a good case and try not to drop it. Maybe one day Bullitt will figure this whole smartphone thing out and I'll give em another try.

  The Cat S61 is indeed a state of the art technology. There is no dought about that, however, you are Putting $1000.00 woth of technology on just features, not on the actual phone.The phone withouth those features is worth $50.00.It lacks the basics fundamental usage of a regular phone. In detail, I must say, there are certain basic funtuions of the phone that are not realy working properly. Camera for example sucks, basics operations seams to be missing a lot of important features , settings system files, not to mention that it clashes with other apps.In reality you are buying a cheap and useless phone just to use a thermal camera, the air sensor and the laser point.

  The battery is by far the worst part. Love the FLIR, the laser (who knew a phone could have a built in cat toy?), etc., and while the battery was fantastic over the first few months I'm now at the point where I can watch the battery power drop a percentage or more every hour. I also experience the problem where the phone indicates a complete charge is there even if it's 0%. The phone will shut down at that point, of course. I usually go through ten to twenty or even more resets on a DAILY basis just to make the phone actually charge; never mind it holding a charge. I will likely contact CAT and ask for another phone, or worst case scenario my money back. I like it's ruggedness and what it does for me. It's just that godforsaken battery.

There was not option to select a North America Version or a European Version on any of the may Cat phone on Amazon that i seen. Make sure to ask the question to the company you are buying it from to make sure that it a North American model if your planning to use here in the USA States.

Yes...  The Tools Are Legit & Verified, but As A Smartphone It Falls Short
","

  This phone is simply amazing.  Hands down so useful (for those so inclined to understand how to properly use the tools) that I even moved my SIM card to this phone.  I was expecting to have a Garage Tool type phone, and that's pretty much what I got.  The LTE is behind, there is no Bluetooth 5.0, and the phone service is lacking from the Galaxy S10 that I have now as a video monitor.  The display is pretty good.  The physical buttons work as both an advantage and a hindrance, but if you know the difference in *when* such a difference occurs; you will truly appreciate the directness of the this phone.  I love the tools, and I'm not giving it up.  I absolutely miss the fingerprint scanner, and optical recognition.  Things have changed, and the usefulness of this phones features far outweigh the sacrifices of any top end smartphone; at least for me at this point in time.I found where the leaks in the door are.  I am able to find which vents are 'soiled' with the air monitor.  The laser measure has been calibrated twice, and both times the physical measurement was >1"" off.  Measurements are for general use, and not for cutting anything to size.  Always overestimate anyways, so it's functional in that respect.It's HUGE!  Hopefully it's tough enough, because there is no way I am putting a case on this beast!  haha.If you read this, then you should just get one while the air monitor is still available!Peace!

This is a good phone if you use it for its industrial purposes.
","

  Pros:IR CAMERA works like a charm (note I have not used any live feed capabilities, just the phone in and of itself)AIR QUALITY DETECT SENSOR picks up everything very well. I just wish that there were more details included in the data collected.DURABILITY is excellent even when dropped on screen from a distance onto a hard surface. I have gotten the phone wet many times and I have never had an issue even with saltwater, cold water, hot water, mist etc. I have dropped the phone in the shower and no water got in it.BATTERY LIFE and CHARGE are long lasting and quick to charge even under heavy use (note turn phone off for very fast charging)SIZE AND WEIGHT are not bad. It is heavy enough to realize it when you leave it somewhere. It isn't a bad weight by any means. Its heavy and durable enough to be used as a weapon and it is definitely designed to withstand military and industrial environments. It fits in my pockets and it is easy to identify as my phone. for the amount of tech in this phone this is pretty compact.Neutral:VISIBLE LIGHT CAMERA does its job. It isn't a bad camera and it isn't a great camera. You can adjust the settings to your liking. This shouldn't be used for your 4k photography to put on social media, but if you use it for social media or pictures it still does a good enough job.ANTENNA has good qualities. I use T-Mobile and the service is good for my area. I am over in Norfolk and it gets about as good as Norfolk is going to get.MEMORY stores a lot of data and is pretty good. I have had no corrupt files or downloads.PHONE IN GENERAL its a phone. This phone is designed to fit industrial and military environments and suits well as a phone for general use.Cons:PROCESSING POWER AND RAM. Obviously this isn't a phone that is going to replace your laptop and it isn't going to be as fast as other phones. It is a bit slower than other phones but when you get used to it its not that bad. You will notice the issue when selecting which aps to close, start up of aps, and sometimes during the operation of the IR camera. It gets the job done and for the money it isn't really that bad. I would like to see CAT pump out more advanced phones with better processing power and with maybe even more tools.CHARGING PORT COVER. This may be my fault but I will list it anyway. The charging port plastic cover tore off after lots of use and abuse. The rubber cover was still in tact but as expected it was a pain to deal with when trying to charge the phone.RANDOM CRASHING. On rare occasions the phone would crash and I would have to press tons of buttons and hit the reset button for it to turn back on. I am not sure what causes this issue but simply trying to power the phone back on will not work after a crash. If this happens you are SOL until you can find a SIM card pin to press the reset button and get lucky with powering it back on. Sometimes this happens when using the camera but I cant pin it to the camera itself. I believe this is processing issue.A summary of my use:The built in tools are fantastic and I wish that more phones were designed around being multi tools rather than for being used for just social media. The camera itself does the job of taking pictures. It isn't designed for photography but it does its job pretty well. The IR camera is awesome and works very well. The processor isn't the greatest but again it does its job. I don't need the fastest phone on the planet to perform tasks. I personally have not had a need to use the laser range finder. However, playing around with it showed that it works well though there are some limitations. You need to be mindful of the laser's limits and understand that it isn't built for long range and the quality of the measurement may be affected by the type of surface you are pointing the laser at. The air quality detect sensor is fantastic as it picks up smoke and alcohol based products very easily. It also picks up paint fumes very well. I work on a ship and this phone has been proven to be extremely useful. I have dropped it multiple times onto hard surfaces from a considerable distance. Even when the phone lands on the screen it hasn't cracked. I also left the plastic on the screen to further protect It from scratches. The only major issue I have had with it at times is that the phone will sometimes crash. When this happens the phone will not power on normally. I generally have to open up the SIM card cover and use a pin to reset the phone as well as hit the power button and square button at the same time. Honestly I am not sure if that is even what turns it back on because sometimes I do that process and it still wont turn back on. So that can be incredibly annoying and I would love to see that fixed. The charge of the battery lasts forever depending on how you use the phone. Even in heavy use the phone retains charge for hours.At the end of the day:I really cant say too much bad about this phone. The pros definitely outweigh the cons. I will be buying from CAT in the future if their product line continues to make considerable advances.

More than the sum of its parts
","

  I received the CAT S61 a week ago so my review is based on 7 days of use.  I did extensive research before buying this phone, well as extensive as possible given there are a limited number of articles about it.  One common theme in the reviews was that the hardware specs were middling, not up to par with the Note 9 or iPhone x.  So far my experience upgrading from a blackberry Priv to the CAT S61 is that this is a snappy phone with a clear, bright screen.  As compared to the Priv this phone is more responsive, the screen while on paper is inferior, in practice seems better.  As a real plus the S61 is unencumbered by the pre-installed bloatware from ATT that I dealt with using the Priv.  The only bundled apps are the core google (android) apps and the special apps that operate the S61's unique hardware tools.About those tools, the air quality/ humidity meter, laser distance measure and thermal camera are really stand out features.  There is literally no competition on the market with these features excepting the previous version CAT S60.  While some of the reviews deride these features as gimmicky, I find them useful in unexpected ways, interesting and fun to use.  The laser distance measure is the most rough around the edges, as it is a little slow and needs periodic calibration. I would also appreciate the ability to measure square footage by combining two measurements automatically.  However those gripes aside, the tool you have is better than the one you don't. In this case I could bring a stand alone laser distance measure everywhere I go but that is not practical and having one in my pocket at all times is nice.The air quality meter is an interesting feature as well.  A fair number of phones have barometric pressure sensors, but this meter adds humidity and VOC pollution.  Humidity is useful for painting, tracking moisture in a basement or outside.  The VOC measurements provide interesting insights into the environment you may not think about.  For example when filling up with gasoline I can see the levels spike, then gradually decrease in the car over time after leaving the station.  In a room with brand new carpet I can see the higher levels of VOC's outgassing and then remember to open a window which I might not have otherwise done.  I think overtime I will be glad to have this and other use cases may present themselves.The FLIR thermal camera is the most outstanding of the unique sensors on this phone.  There are external thermal cameras with better specifications available but they require charging, external power and remembering to tote them along.  With the integrated camera this awesome feature is always with you.  I have found it interesting to see where the joists are in the walls of my apartment, where the dog has been sleeping, to see hotspots on my computer and tell whether electronics such as security cameras are active.  There are really a multitude of legitimately useful applications for the thermal camera as well as a number of fun and interesting use cases.The phone is a large unit and relatively heavy as phones go.  Side by side with my work iPhone it its otterbox case the Cat is still considerably bigger.  The trade off is a big battery and solid durable construction.  The handset feels substantial in the hand and conveys a solid sense of quality.  That it is waterproof, shock resistant and operable in a wide temperature range are a plus to me as an outdoorsman.  I willingly take the heft and size as a tradeoff for a durable phone considering that the svelte luxurious to touch phones like the iPhone require bulky cases to protect them negating much of their advantage.That size and not quite top tier specs offer an advantage which is stellar battery life.  On a business trip I used the phone for over twenty four hours, at least an hour of talk time and 6-7 hours of screen use, still leaving 30% battery life.  It is a real advantage to not have to moderate use to conserve battery and be able to go all day and then some with battery to spare.  Taken with all of the features and durability this phone is a unique product and a real work horse for someone that wants a phone to go the extra mile.

Good So Far
","

  So far so good. I am upgrading from a Samsung S7 active. I wanted a durable phone and this sure seems to be one. It is a big phone, but it still fits in my blue jean pocket.  The FLIR camera works well. I love that it does not have all the bloatware that my old AT&T phone had on it. One of my only gripes is that it uses a different charging cable, so I need to replace all my MicroUSB charging cables to some nonstandard or new standard charging cable. I also have not figured out the measure in picture thing.The waterproof rating seems to be the real deal. I went snorkeling and brought it out to take some underwater pictures and it worked. It has an underwater mode that uses the volume button to take pictures because the touch screen does not work underwater. I have to admit I was a little nervous using my $800 smartphone as an underwater camera, so I put it up after 15 min of light diving. There are limitations to how deep the phone can go, 10 feet is it.A negative I have experienced is I can not make wifi calls with it. I read that it was AT&T that limited this and not the phone. I was able to use my old Samsung to make Wifi calls but not this one.Overall I am really happy with it.

  Okay... This phone is amazing... I've followed the s60 and the reviews it was receiving about bad signal, the s61 reviews seemed better and they truly are.

  Is that a brick in your pocket? Oh that's your phone, what century is it from?Not a flashy, sleek or sexy device. What it does do more than makes up for that to me. It lasts all day! Streaming or just trying to acquire a signal in the remote recesses of the world. It takes a beating freezing cold, summer heat, left it in the windshield on the dashboard no problems. Thermal troubleshooting just by reaching into your pocket no pelican case, no plug in or media transfer. Oh yeah and water proof design mean easy cleanup when it accidentally lands in hydraulic fluid. Easy planning with built in measure application. It's not a phone it's a tool you'll use all day long that also makes calls. I love this thing!!!

GSM in USA is tough on its features
","

  First, this is an excellent tough phone, but since it uses GSM in North America you're stuck with AT&T towers. If you use AT&T as your carrier you will not have wifi calling nor VoLTE. They turn these off because you didn't and can't buy the phone from them. I did have the features for about one week until AT&T did a sweep and found the unbranded phone on their network and disabled those features. I switched to Puretalk and the same thing happened. This not not my opinion, AT&T will tell you this, just not upfront.

  This phone is much, much quicker than the S60, but just as solid. I put the protective case on it (I know, REALLY?!) and it has helped with the inevitable drops and skids across the floor. Battery life is amazing; I'm getting two days straight running Wifi and LTE data with 20-30% still remaining. Vibration is STRONG and ring is loud; just what I need to draw attention to it in busy and noisy environments.Overall, I'm glad I got it...even though the S62 came out the day after it arrived... :D

WARNING: ONLY THE MOST DESPERATE SHOULD PURCHASE
","

  I did purchase this phone only as an interim phone while researching and deciding on what I would like next.  That said, I will be doing great to tolerate this horrible contraption for longer than a couple weeks at best.  If you do not text much, or do any form of ""writing"" on your phone, you may get by decently.  Texting or messaging of any kind on this phone feels like having gone back to a cell phone from 2009-ish.  Auto-correct is incredibly awful to contend with.  You get the ""dropdown"" bar with selections (almost never accurate selections either) to choose from, and to go around that you have to tap somewhere else and hope you're still on the word needing corrected.  Even worse (see screenshot of typing), while I do not use but one social media platform, on the one I do use the text field entirely DISAPPEARS when I type anything, whether it be a comment or a direct message.  I've never seen anything like it.  I literally have to back in and out to attempt to correct any typos, and then hope I have gotten them all.As for other noticeable irritating issues, I downloaded my banking app, as this is the primary way I keep track of my accounts - my bank account, which I have never had trouble with on ANY other phone, ever, will not even load on this phone, no matter what I have tried or how many times.The camera - oh help us, the camera.  It is a bare bones basic at best.  If you take many pictures, as I tend to especially out in nature - give it up, my friends.  This is NOT what you're looking for.  Don't think about zooming in - the quality gets even worse, and very quickly.  And unless I am just completely unable to locate it, I see NO way to video anything at all.I will stop here, because this horrid little thing has taken up enough of my screen (desktop PC) time and minutes of my life to leave a review in hopes to warn others.  I would say if you're buying as an intro phone for a teen, go for it.  Beyond that, I would steer clear!

Internal Ear Speaker Quit working just after the time I could have returned it.
","

  Just after the return period (1 month), the ear piece speaker quit working completely. For phone calls, I had to have it on speaker phone or blue tooth ear piece. I tried everything to fix this. I looked up advice on every forum and website I could find that mentioned this issue. Factory reset, double checking settings, disabling blue tooth, and more. What I found while looking for an answer to this issue is that apparently LG phones frequently have this problem because the wiring that connects the ear piece speaker is apparently weak and it's not uncommon for those wires to detach or come loose from the speaker so the only way to fix this is to open the phone up and get into the electronic guts and solder it back together. Ridiculous. Super disappointed as I did like everything else about this phone. And because this happened 34 days after purchase, I can't return it and am now stuck with a phone I can't use. Damn you LG >.<

short battery life, clearly a glitchy version of the actual phone
","

  The battery life is awful for a new phone. I used to buy this model new at Best Buy all the time, so I could tell the battery this phone came with was drained. It's glitchy. I constantly have to restart it 20 times because the phone keeps claiming I have ""No Service"" even though my service is completely fine. Around the 15th time or so, it finally decides to connect to my service. This thing is horrible and I would return it if I could, but Amazon does a 30 day return limit which is a scam for phones.update:I had this phone before with a major retailer and had no issues. However, this amazon seller seems to sell glitchy versions of this same phone. I really want to like this phone but it keeps requiring a restart because it is not registering my sim card even though I definitely have service (my phone bill is paid off). Half the time, it redirects you to a firmware update screen that never, ever loads all the way through. I have spent 40 minutes restarting my phone and hoping it registers my service to no avail. I HATE THIS PHONE.

  This is the second one of these I thought. The first one held up very well for well over a year. The only reason I replaced it was I dropped it in the screen glass broke. My son taped it up with clear packing tape and is still using that first phone and that makes it a year-and-a-half come December. This phone that I bought from Amazon instead of Walmart where I bought my last one is the exact same make and model because I liked that one so much. We are only 3 months in in the screen is going out. Unfortunately because it's a cheap phone I did not buy the warranty I should have. I have been religious about keeping it in a good case. If you buy this phone I would definitely get the warranty because it will either be really good or suck very quickly.

  Firstly & Most Important:*Before you activate your phone, even before you connect it to Wi-Fi.*Search through the apps installed, and uninstall 'Mobile Services Manager'!!!It sounds like a nessessary application but it is not, search it up now, it will burn through precious data like a hot knife through butter. Should be a law past banning such things. It will install other apps & games endlessly!!!Ok. Having said that. I am very pleased with the phone itself, at this pricepoint it has what I need, not the bells and whistles of a flagship device. People complain about the power button on the back, but you can Double Tap the screen to wake it up and put it back to sleep. Get a case because this device feels slick and could break easily.

Awesome buy

  I liked this phone so much ive since purchased 3 more. I got another for myself because the dog ate my phone and i got one for my son and one for my daughter. These are cheap but work great and are great starter phones for kids who you dont want to spend a thousand dollars on for an iPhone they will break or lose, also great for people like me who use the phone for calling/texting and just some Amazon shopping.. Anywho, service is also very reasonable. You get discounts for multiple lines. I pay $70 for 3 lines with unlimited call/text and 4gb data. You cant even get that kind of service for one line with these other companies. I highly recommend both phone and at&t service.

Love this phone

  I was having trouble with Sprint. I cracked the face of my phone and they wanted me to pay to get it fixed BEFORE I could return it so I went to Amazon and found this AT&T phone, the LG phoenix. I've had LG phones before and love them so I ordered it and it came right away. I love it. Signed up with AT&T prepaid phone and now I pay less than I was with Sprint and the internet is fast on this phone. I would recommend to anyone.

  Bought it to use with my ATT plan. Had no problems getting it connected with my plan even though it's a pre paid phone. Good phone for price! Does everything I need it for!
